# General Soliciation

When a non-profit tax-exempt organization is approved by the IRS, general solicitiation is permitted because there is more public reporting requirements for a non-profit than most publicly traded companies.

Donations are usually tas deductible as long as the donor receives no benefit from the donation?

Membership fees are not tax deductible when they provide a direct benefit or privilege such as voting rights.

For newly formed non-profits while waiting for tax exempt status to be approved, can solicit members (see https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/applying-for-tax-exempt-status and https://www.stayexempt.irs.gov/)

Also non-profit tax exempt organizations can offer tax exempt bonds up to $14,000,000.
