# Folio Number Creation

The folio number is a means by which properties are identified in Miami-Dade County. It is also referred to as the parcel identifier and represents a unique number that computer systems use to associate to a property. The folios number is formatted as a 13 digit number ( **99-9999-999-9999** ). The composition of the folio number includes ***Municipality** , ***Township** ,* **Range** , ***Section** ,** ****Sub-division** and** **Parcel Identifier** as described below.

**Municipality:
**The 1st two digits of the folio number are the municipal code as listed on this adjoining chart. Code 30 indicates properties in Miami-Dade County not within the municipality, otherwise referred to as “unincorporated.”

**Township, Range, and Section:
**The next 4 digits indicate the, Township, Range and Section based on the** ** **Public Land Survey System (PLSS)** .

**Township:
**The first digit is the township number. Townships run from North to South in ascending order. Miami-Dade starts with township 51 in the north and changes every 6 miles going South until township 59. The first number of the township (5) is omitted and only the second number is used in the folio number. A township is 36 square miles.

**Range:
**The second of these 4 is the range number. Range numbers start with range 35 in the extreme West and change every 6 miles going East until range 42. The first digit of the range (3 or 4) is omitted and only the last number is used in the folio number.

**Section:
**The last two digits are the section number. This could be any number between 1 and 36, there being 36 sections in each township and range grid. A section is normally one square mile.

**Sub-Division:
**The next 3 digits are the subdivision number, acreage or plat. Un-subdivided properties will show 000 in this portion of the folio number. Every subdivision within a section is given a consecutive number. Therefore, 006 within a section is the 6^th^ subdivision recorded within this section. Some acreage parcels were originally part of old subdivisions and carries 001 or 002 designation under subdivision, even though these are large tracts (acreage).

**Parcel Identifier:
**The last 4 digits are the actual parcel number.

*Using the example folio   *30-4015-009-0020 you can break it down as follows:

| **30** | **4015**                                     | **009** | **0020**    |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| Municipality | Township 5**4 **Range 4**0**Section 15 | Sub-division  | Parcel Identifier |
