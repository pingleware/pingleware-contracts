# Exempt Debt Token Offering
Regulation D also provides for exempt offerings of debt securities. That is typically corporate bonds, paper, etc. aka as public debt.

The introduction to Ethereum proof of staking, where a token can earn from holding a token instead of trading makes introducing public debt securities to the blockchain feasible.

The applicable EIP is EIP-3475: Multiple Callable Bonds available at https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3475
