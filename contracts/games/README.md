# Blockchain in Gaming

The first tokenization of real world assets was in the arcade game rooms where you exchange currency for game tokens to be used in the merchant machines.

The same can be applied by exchanging cryptocurrency for game tokens to be used for gaming.

## Bingo

Under Florida statutes a bingo game can be established (https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2021/849.0931), but private lotteries are unlawful.

Instant Bingo is more suitable for blockchain.

### Prize Structure

Remember that the specific prize structures and rules can vary significantly from one bingo game to another. Players should always review the rules and prize structure for the specific game they are participating in to understand what is at stake and how to win.

1. **Jackpot Bingo**: This is a progressive jackpot prize, where a specific pattern or number of calls are set, and if nobody wins within those calls, the jackpot prize increases for the next game.
2. **Consolation Prizes**: In addition to the main prizes, some bingo games offer consolation prizes for players who achieve certain patterns or milestones, even if they don't win the main prize.
3. **Multiple Winners**: In many bingo games, if multiple players complete the winning pattern on the same call, the prize is divided among the winners.
4. **Tiered Prizes**: Prizes can vary based on the speed of achieving the winning pattern. The first player to complete the pattern might get a larger prize, while subsequent winners receive smaller prizes.
5. **Special Themed Games**: Bingo games can have themed prizes based on holidays, seasons, or special occasions. For example, Halloween bingo might offer prizes related to the holiday.
6. **Community Jackpots**: In some bingo games, if no one wins the jackpot, a community jackpot is awarded to all participants in the game.
7. **Guaranteed Prizes**: Organizers may offer guaranteed prizes, ensuring that a minimum amount is awarded, even if there are only a few participants.
