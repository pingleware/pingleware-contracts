# Deployed Contract Addresses
The smart contracts are being designed to be shared with any contract that follows the method signature rules, hence saving gas fees from multiple deployments.
To invoke a deployed contract on the blockchain, you will need the contract address and an interface definition.

The deployed contract addresses will be listed here, while the interface definitions are listed in the contracts/interfaces directory.

    <InterfaceDefinition> Contract = <InterfaceDefinition>([contract_address]);
    Contract.<method>([any arguments])

The <InterfaceDefinition> is replaced with the name of interface in the contracts/interfaces directory.

On Ethereum Mainnet,

        Version             Deployed Date       Name                    Contract Address
        -------             -------------       ----                    ----------------

On Ropsten Testnet,

        Version             Deployed Date       Name                    Contract Address
        -------             -------------       ----                    ----------------

## GraphQL
GraphQL is the preferred indexing service which collects Ethereum events and exports them through GraphQL endpoints. It is widely used in the Ethereum ecosystem which supports fast and cheap queries for DApps.
