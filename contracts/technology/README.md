Technology covers a wide arena of subtopics. One area of how blockchain will benefit technology is software licensing via NFT.

An existing project which adds NFT software licensing to an application ia located at https://github.com/vantezzen/nftlicense, which also describes deployment to an NFT marketplace like OpenSea.

You can eliminate the central server by including a callback REST API in the application using Express, and require the user to obtain a free opensea API keey from https://docs.opensea.io/reference/request-an-api-key and store in a user-defined settings.json file. The NFT license contract address is embedded in the client server process.

You can limit the number of licenses by setting the total supply to a low value, the owner mint function can add more NFT licenses.

Using the above procedure, PressPage Entertainment Inc DBA PINGLEWARE created a blockchain software license NFT for the Ethereum Smart Contract Creator application at https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/36333753202514414869774196218446368102124864803313914227828195906940117664320
