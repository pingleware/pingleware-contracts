# Blockchain in Technology
Technology covers a wide arena of subtopics. One area of how blockchain will benefit technology is software licensing via NFT.

An existing project which adds NFT software licensing to an application ia located at https://github.com/vantezzen/nftlicense, which also describes deployment to an NFT marketplace like OpenSea.

You can eliminate the central server by including a callback REST API in the application using Express, and require the user to obtain a free opensea API keey from https://docs.opensea.io/reference/request-an-api-key and store in a user-defined settings.json file. The NFT license contract address is embedded in the client server process.

You can limit the number of licenses by setting the total supply to a low value, the owner mint function can add more NFT licenses.

Using the above procedure, PressPage Entertainment Inc DBA PINGLEWARE created a blockchain software license NFT for the Ethereum Smart Contract Creator application at https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/36333753202514414869774196218446368102124864803313914227828195906940117664320

# Listing NFT Software License on OpenSea
The instructions from https://github.com/vantezzen/nftlicense self explanatory for creating a new NFT token. If you are creating your first NFT, your token is placed in an unnamed collection. You can edit that collection and update your collection metadata. Once your NFT license is created, it is not ready for sale until your freeze and press sell to list the NFT.

I recommend finalizing your metadata, including hiring a professional logo designer for the artwork and a writer for the bio and marketing prose (fiverr.com)

When you list your NFT license token for sale, you will then pay some gas fee, using the gas tracker at https://etherscan.io/gastracker, you can deploy when gas is the lowest.

A helpful description for selling digital art which can be applied to NFT license tokens is available at https://opensea.io/blog/guides/the-beginners-guide-to-creating-selling-digital-art-nfts/
