# Pharmaceuticals on the Blockchain
A practical use is to maintain a list of samples of pharmaceutricals given to medical professionals as required by law.

When implementing blockchain solutions for pharma, no personal identifying information or PII, should be stored on the blockchain, which could be a HIPAA violation.
