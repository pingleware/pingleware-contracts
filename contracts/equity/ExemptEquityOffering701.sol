 * Employee benefit plans – Rule 701
 * See https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/exemptofferings/rule701
 *
 * Rule 701 exempts certain sales of securities made to compensate employees, consultants and advisors.
 * This exemption is not available to Exchange Act reporting companies. A company can sell at least $1 million of securities under this exemption,
 * regardless of its size. A company can sell even more if it satisfies certain formulas based on its assets or on the number of its outstanding securities.
 * If a company sells more than $10 million in securities in a 12-month period, it is required to provide certain financial and other disclosure to the persons
 * that received securities in that period. Securities issued under Rule 701 are “restricted securities” and may not be freely traded unless the securities
 * are registered or the holders can rely on an exemption
