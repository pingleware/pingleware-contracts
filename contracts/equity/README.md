A traditional private placement offering involves filing a FORM D on the SEC.GOV EDGAR filing system, creating a private placement memorandum and then searching for qualified and accredited investors. Prior to cryptocurrency and blockchain, liquidity in the private equity markets was limited until the company initiated an IPO. Under rule 144, creates liquidity in a private equity offering after twelve months from each sale of restricted securities. Using cryptocurrency for the private equity offering on the Ethereum network can create compliance liquidity before an IPO as well as generate a market value.

The introduction to equity trading tokens on the etheruem network make the search for accredited investors easier because liquidity is possible after the first twelve months of the offering under Rule 144. The market rate of the equity is established when the accredited investors have resold their holdings after twelve months have lapsed. Establishing a market rate in a private equity offering can prevent exorbitant valuations when a full IPO/DPO via a S-1 becomes effective.

Issuing preferred stock only during the private equity offering adds protection for the investors by placing them in a protected class similar to creditors, so in the event of court-ordered liquidation, the company assets can be sold to recover preferred equity investors funds.

A private equity offering should limit the maximum preferred shares to 10% of the total authorized shares specified in the company's charter, otherwise additional reporting requirements will be needed when new investors are vested. For example, a company with 1,000,000 authorized shares listed in it's charter, should limit private equity preferred outstanding shares to 100,000. The remaining 900,000 authorized shares can used for other offerings at a later date.

# Why an Exempt Offering on the Blockchain?
Prior to exempt blockchain offering, the accredited investor would have to wait for the company to conduct an unrestricted IPO before they can sell their holdings. Using the blockchain for exempt offerings, liquidity is automatically available based on the exemption?

# A Defi DAPP is required
A Decentralized-finance (Defi) distributed application (DAPP) is required to maintain SEC compliance for exempt offerings including but not limited to KYC, AML, and Transfer Agent responsibilities.

The source code for the Defi DAPP will reside in the src directory

# Funding Categories

The former meaning,

    Series A - pre-seed funding private individuals and entities
    Series B - private equity
    Series C - higher funding goals that regulation A+ offers

the former series of funding was sequential, A before B before C?

the new meaning,

    Series A - under the rules for Regulation A
    Series B - under the rules for Regulation B (bank and institutional investors)
    Series C - under the rules for Regulation CF - Crowdfunding
    Series D - under the rules for Regulation D (this repository)
    Series 10 - under the rules of Regulation 10-12/G|B

the new definition permits any order of funding based on the SEC regulation?
