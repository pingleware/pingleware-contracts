# Membership Token
A membership token is useful for non-profit organizations and private clubs to offer memberships via the blockchain (see https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1261.md). A membership token cannot be traded for profit and steps must prevent and trading or the membership token will be interpreted as asecurity and requires registration? A membership token can be used for a private investment as long as the membership does not exceed 100 members, as well as other requirements for a private investment club (see https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsinvclubhtm.html and https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/guidance/private-fund-adviser-resources.htm). A membeship token is suited for non-profit memebers to accept non-tax deductible membership fees which give the members voting rights as well as to private investment clubs that can used the membership token as the initial or follow on investment.

# General Solicatitation
When a non-profit tax-exempt organization is approved by the IRS, general solicitiation is permitted because there is more public reporting requirements for a non-profit than most publicly traded companies. Membership fees are not tax deductible when they provide a direct benefit or privilege such as voting rights. For newly formed non-profits while waiting for tax exempt status to be approved, can solicit members (see https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/applying-for-tax-exempt-status and https://www.stayexempt.irs.gov/)

Private investment clubs typically do no have the privilege of general solicitation or their club announcement may be interpreted as a public offering requiring registration. Typically private investment clubs must market to investors who the club already has an existing relationship? What investment clubs have done, is to offer free courses requiring a user registration or a free newsletter subscription (abiding by CAN SPAM ACT laws, including opt-out), with a waiting period of at least 12 months or more, before the invitation to the investment club is sent?
