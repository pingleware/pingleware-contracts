# Membership Token
A membership token is useful for non-profit organizations and private clubs to offer memberships via the blockchain (see https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1261.md). A membership token cannot be traded for profit and steps must prevent and trading or the membership token will be interpreted as a security and requires registration? A membership token can be used for a private investment as long as the membership does not exceed 100 members, as well as other requirements for a private investment club (see https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsinvclubhtm.html and https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/guidance/private-fund-adviser-resources.htm). A membeship token is suited for non-profit memebers to accept non-tax deductible membership fees which give the members voting rights as well as to private investment clubs that can used the membership token as the initial or follow on investment.

The Membership token present is NOT a tradeable security but a method for creating a membership lists for other purposes.

# General Solicatitation
Private investment clubs typically do no have the privilege of general solicitation or their club announcement may be interpreted as a public offering requiring registration. Typically private investment clubs must market to investors who the club already has an existing relationship? What investment clubs have done, is to offer free courses requiring a user registration or a free newsletter subscription (abiding by CAN SPAM ACT laws, including opt-out), with a waiting period of at least 12 months or more, before the invitation to the investment club is sent? (please refer to a qualified attorney for the mechanics on lawyers.com or avvo.com)
