        forward-looking statements

        uncertainties, nor can
        the Fund assess the impact of all factors on the Fund&rsquo;s business or the extent to which any factor, or
        combination of factors, may
        cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. In light of
        these and other uncertainties,
        the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this Registration Statement should not be regarded

                    housing has gained a comparative edge in tenant demand. Regardless of the state of the economy,

                    are losing interest in owning, many millennials delayed or abandoned home buying plans, and

        projected returns of
        a prospective investment, quantifies the risk of each investment, evaluates relative value, and analyzes
        corporate governance and voting
        rights of a Targeted Asset. Industry factors are considered as part of the underwriting process, as well as in
        portfolio construction.
        Surveillance extends the initial underwriting process throughout the life of an investment, and the Investment
        Adviser has an ongoing
        portfolio risk monitoring process to identify deteriorating situations or investment opportunities. Finally, the

        clusters of manufactured homes located on a single parcel. They range in size from fewer than 10 homes to

        comprise the largest share of unsubsidized affordable home ownership in the U.S., and communities occur in both
        rural and urban areas.
        Like community land trust homeowners, manufactured homeowners own their houses and rent their land. There are
        around 40,000 manufactured
        housing communities in the United States with about 4.2 million home sites. In these communities, residents
        typically rent the land where
        the home resides. Some communities also have homes for rent. Typically included in land-lease rental payments
        are fees for professional
        property management services that usually include the care, maintenance and upkeep of parking lots, storage
        rooms, laundry rooms, pools,
        playgrounds and community centers, as well as landscaping of commons areas. Manufactured housing provides a
        competitive alternative to

        refers to properties
        that offer month-to-month storage unit rental for personal or business use. Self-storage offers a cost-effective
        and flexible storage
        alternative. Customers rent fully enclosed spaces that can vary in size according to their specific needs.
        Customers are responsible for
        moving their items into and out of their units. Self-storage unit sizes typically range from five feet by five
        feet to 10 feet by 40 feet.</P>

    <P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The self-storage industry
        benefits from demand
        drivers that occur during both expansionary and recessionary economic environments. The six key demand drivers
        of self-storage are: (1)
        population growth; (2) percentage of renter-occupied housing units; (3) average household size; (4) average
        household income; (5) supply
        constraints; and (6) economic growth. Customers choose a self-storage property based largely on the convenience
        of the site to their home
        or business. Therefore, high-density, high-traffic population centers are ideal locations for a self-storage
        property. A property&rsquo;s
        perceived security and the general professionalism of the site managers and staff are also contributing factors
        to a site&rsquo;s ability
        to secure rentals. Although most self-storage properties are leased to customers on a month-to-month basis,
        customers tend to continue
        their leases for extended periods of time. However, there are seasonal fluctuations in occupancy rates for
        self-storage properties. Generally,
        there is increased leasing activity at self-storage properties during the late spring and early summer months
        due to the higher number
        of people who relocate during this period.</P>

        residences also include age-restricted communities. The Fair Housing Act of 1968 (&ldquo;FHA&rdquo;) was enacted
        to prohibit discrimination
        in the sale, rental and financing of dwellings based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin. In 1988,
        the FHA was amended to
        prohibit discrimination based on familial status, which is commonly referred to as age-based discrimination.
        However, there are exceptions
        for housing developments that qualify as housing for older persons. In 1995, Congress enacted The Housing for
        Older Persons Act (&ldquo;HOPA&rdquo;),
        which set forth the legal requirements for such excepted housing developments. Based on HOPA, there are two
        types of permissible age-restricted
        housing communities. The first requires all residents to be 62 years of age or older and the second requires at
        least 80% of the occupied
        units to be occupied by at least one person who is 55 years of age or older.</P>

        communities offer easy access to amenities such as golf courses, performance theaters, fitness centers, swimming
        pools, tennis courts,
        gaming rooms, internet caf&eacute;s, club houses, walking and jogging trails, water fronts, concierge services,
        meal services, housekeeping

        or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued
        by the U.S. government

    <P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The discussion below
        generally describes the tax
        consequences to investors of certain likely investments assuming that they are held by the Fund directly or
        through subsidiaries that
        are transparent, i.e., disregarded or treated as partnerships, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Fund,
        however, is likely to hold
        at least some investments through subsidiaries that are not transparent for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
        The Fund may choose (but
        is not required) to hold investments through a non-transparent subsidiary in order to address 1940 Act issues,
        enable the Fund to satisfy
        the &ldquo;qualified income&rdquo; exception under the publicly traded partnership rules (described below),
        prevent Shareholders from
        having to file state tax returns in a state in which the Fund otherwise might have a taxable presence, block
        &ldquo;unrelated business
        taxable income&rdquo; for tax-exempt Shareholders, avoid causing the Fund or Shareholders to have tax filing and
        payment obligations in
        Canada or in other jurisdictions outside the United States, or for other reasons. Some non-transparent
        subsidiaries, e.g., U.S. corporate
        subsidiaries, may involve subsidiary-level tax leakage, while others, e.g., a REIT, formed to hold mortgage
        loans, may involve certain
        increased costs but not tax leakage and, under current law, tax benefits for certain Shareholders. The use of
        non-transparent subsidiaries
        may also affect whether the Fund is engaged in business with respect to particular investments, which can affect
        taxation of Shareholders
        as described below. The Investment Adviser, in its sole discretion, will determine whether to hold particular
        investments through non-transparent

    <P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">It is intended that the Fund
        will be treated as
        a partnership and not as an association taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under
        applicable Regulations, a
        U.S. non-corporate entity such as the Fund is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
        unless it elects to be
        classified as an association taxable as a corporation. The Fund has not elected, and does not intend to elect,
        to be classified as an
        association taxable as a corporation.</P>

    <P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">An entity that is otherwise
        classified as a partnership
        may be taxed as a corporation if it is a &ldquo;publicly traded partnership&rdquo; (&ldquo;PTP&rdquo;) as
        defined in Section 7704 of the
        Code. A PTP is a partnership the interests in which are traded on an established securities market or are
        readily tradable on a secondary
        market or the substantial equivalent thereof. Shares will not be traded on an established securities market.
        Under applicable Regulations,
        a partnership&rsquo;s redemption plan may be treated as the substantial equivalent of a secondary market in
        certain circumstances. Treasury
        Regulations concerning the classification of partnerships as PTPs provide certain safe harbors under which
        interests in a partnership
        will not be considered readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent hereof).
        Alternatively, to the extent the
        Fund seeks to rely on the &ldquo;qualifying income&rdquo; exception, there are no assurances that the fund will
        satisfy the qualifying
        income test each year.</P>

        PTP, will not be
        taxed as a corporation if 90% or more of its gross income each year consists of &ldquo;qualifying income,&rdquo;
        including interest. There
        are no assurances that 90% of the Fund&rsquo;s income will be qualifying income. The Fund may make or hold
        certain investments through
        subsidiaries that are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes to assist its efforts to
        satisfy the qualifying income
        exception. If the Fund were to be classified as a PTP that is not taxed as a corporation because of application
        of the qualifying income
        exception, the passive loss rules would be applied separately with respect to a Shareholder&rsquo;s interest in
        the Fund, <I>e.g.</I>,
        a Shareholder would not be able to use its share of passive losses of the Fund to offset passive income from
        other sources.</P>

        Shareholders, and the Fund
        would be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on its taxable income. In addition, distributions made to
        Shareholders out of the

        income tax but will file information returns reporting the Fund&rsquo;s income and the Shareholders&rsquo;
        respective shares thereof.

        share of the Fund&rsquo;s
        income, gains, losses, deductions and credits. While the Fund will use its best efforts to release to each
        Shareholder a Schedule K-1

        the Fund&rsquo;s items
        of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit, or an adjustment to the allocation of such items among the

        a Shareholder could bear tax liabilities attributable to adjustments to audited years in which it was not a

        representative has the authority to, and may, extend such period with respect to all Shareholders. There can be
        no assurance that the

        returns will be made as
        a result of such an audit. Potential investors are encouraged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the
        possible implications of
        the partnership audit rules on an investment in the Fund.</P>

        &ldquo;U.S. Shareholder&rdquo;
        means a Shareholder of the Fund that (i) (a) is a citizen or resident for U.S. federal income tax purposes of
        the United States, (b) is
        a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax consequences) created or
        organized in or under the
        laws of the United States or of any political subdivision thereof, (c) is an estate, the income of which is
        subject to U.S. federal income
        taxation regardless of its source or (d) is a trust, if a court within the United States is able to exercise
        primary supervision over
        the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. fiduciaries have the authority to control all substantial
        decisions of the trust
        and (ii) is not an entity that has special status under the Code, such as a tax-exempt organization. The tax
        treatment of partners in
        a partnership, or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, generally is a
        function of the nature of
        the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships investing in the Fund or persons investing in
        the Fund through a partnership
        should consult their own tax advisors regarding the taxation of such investment.</P>

        without regard to whether any
        distribution has been or will be received from the Fund. Each item generally will have the same character as
        though the U.S. Shareholder
        had realized the item directly. Because U.S. Shareholders will be required to include Fund income, including
        Fund income for which the
        Fund has no corresponding cash receipts, in their respective income tax returns without regard to whether there
        are distributions attributable
        to that income, U.S. Shareholders may be required to find other sources from which to pay the federal income
        taxes arising out of their

        U.S. Shareholder, including,
        for this purpose, any reduction in the U.S. Shareholder&rsquo;s share of the Fund&rsquo;s liabilities, are first
        applied to reduce the
        U.S. Shareholder&rsquo;s tax basis in its Shares. To the extent such distributions exceed such basis, they will
        result in taxable gain
        to the U.S. Shareholder. In general, distributions (other than liquidating distributions) of property other than
        cash will reduce the
        basis (but not below zero) of a U.S. Shareholder&rsquo;s Shares by the amount of the Fund&rsquo;s basis in such
        property immediately before
        its distribution, but will not result in the realization of income to the U.S. Shareholder. On the complete
        liquidation of a U.S. Shareholder&rsquo;s
        Shares, (i) if the U.S. Shareholder receives only cash, such U.S. Shareholder generally will recognize gain or

        U.S. Shareholder receives
        cash and other property, or only other property, such U.S. Shareholder generally will not recognize loss, but
        will be required to recognize
        gain equal to the excess (if any) of the amount of cash received over the U.S. Shareholder&rsquo;s adjusted tax
        basis in its Shares. Any
        gain or loss recognized in this context generally will be treated as capital gain or loss, except to the extent

        </I>There are a number
        of uncertainties under U.S. federal income tax law relating to debt restructurings. In general, a
        &ldquo;significant modification&rdquo;
        of a debt obligation is treated as a taxable event, with the resulting gain or loss measured by the difference
        between the principal amount
        (or, in some cases, the fair market value) of the debt after the modification and the holder&rsquo;s tax basis
        in such debt before the
        modification. Other than with respect to certain modifications specified in the Regulations, the determination
        of whether a modification
        is &ldquo;significant&rdquo; is based on all of the facts and circumstances. Therefore, it is possible that the
        IRS could take the position
        that a restructuring of a debt instrument acquired by the Fund amounts to a &ldquo;significant
        modification&rdquo; that should be treated
        as a taxable event. A restructuring that results in a &ldquo;significant modification&rdquo; could also result
        in the conversion of market
        discount into OID and cause holders to have to accrue discount income currently. If the Fund were to acquire
        debt investments at significant
        discounts in the secondary market, debt restructurings could cause the Fund to recognize substantial gain (i.e.,
        the excess of the principal
        amount of a restructured debt investment over the Fund&rsquo;s purchase price) required to be currently included
        in income although no
        cash is likely to be received by the Fund in connection with debt restructurings.</P>

            and Other Financial
            Instruments</I>. In the case of &ldquo;Section 1256 Contracts&rdquo;, the Code generally applies a
        mark-to-market system of taxing unrealized
        gains and losses on such contracts and otherwise provides for special rules of taxation. A Section 1256 Contract
        includes certain regulated
        futures contracts, certain foreign currency forward contracts, and certain options contracts. Under these rules,
        Section 1256 Contracts
        held by the Fund at the end of each taxable year of the Fund are treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as
        if they were sold by
        the Fund for their fair market value on the last business day of such taxable year. The net gain or loss, if
        any, resulting from such
        deemed sales (known as &ldquo;marking to market&rdquo;), together with any gain or loss resulting from actual
        dispositions of Section
        1256 Contracts, must be taken into account by the Fund in computing its taxable income for such year. If a
        Section 1256 Contract held
        by the Fund at the end of a taxable year is sold in the following year, the amount of any gain or loss realized
        by the Fund attributable
        to such sale will be adjusted to reflect the gain or loss previously taken into account under the &ldquo;marking
        to market&rdquo; rules.
        Capital gains and losses from such Section 1256 Contracts generally are characterized as short-term capital
        gains or losses to the extent
        of 40% thereof and as long-term capital gains or losses to the extent of 60% thereof. Certain elections may be
        available that would alter
        this treatment, but the Fund may choose not to make any such election for administrative or other reasons. If an
        individual taxpayer incurs
        a net capital loss for a year, the portion thereof, if any, consisting of a net loss on Section 1256 Contracts
        may, at the election of
        such individual, be carried back three years. Losses so carried back may be deducted only against net capital
        gain to the extent it includes
        gains on Section 1256 Contracts. The Fund may hold various positions that may be subject to special provisions
        of the Code that, among
        other things, may affect the character of gains and losses (capital or ordinary) the timing of recognition of
        gain or loss and whether
        capital gains or losses are long-term or short-term.</P>

        income to the extent that the distribution is paid out of the issuer&rsquo;s current or accumulated earnings and
        profits (as determined
        under U.S. federal income tax principles). To the extent that the amount of a distribution exceeds current and
        accumulated earnings and

        tax-exempt entities,
        including qualified pension plans and individual retirement accounts, are generally exempt from U.S. federal
        income tax, but are taxable
        on unrelated business taxable income or &ldquo;UBTI&rdquo;. Where a tax-exempt entity owns an interest in a

        the activities of the partnership are attributed to it for purposes of determining whether the tax-exempt
        entity&rsquo;s distributive
        share of partnership income is UBTI. UBTI generally is derived from either (i) an &ldquo;unrelated trade or
        business&rdquo; carried on
        by the Fund (or by a partnership or limited liability company in which the Fund is a partner or member) or (ii)
        &ldquo;debt-financed&rdquo;
        property owned by the Fund. For each tax-exempt Shareholder, the unrelated business income tax generally applies

        derived by a tax-exempt entity from an unrelated trade or business that it regularly carries on, less the
        deductions directly connected
        with that trade or business. Separate calculations are made for each unrelated trade or business of the exempt
        organization, with losses
        usable only against the applicable unrelated trade or business and not against all UBTI generally. Section
        512(b) of the Code, however,
        provides that interest, dividends, certain rents from real property, gain from the sale of property that is not
        held for sale to customers
        in the ordinary course of business and certain other types of income generally are not treated as UBTI.</P>

        gross income or gain not otherwise treated as UBTI (less the same percentage of applicable deductions) that is
        derived from any property
        that is subject to &ldquo;acquisition indebtedness.&rdquo; Acquisition indebtedness includes (i) the amount of
        any mortgage or lien to
        which property is subject at the time of its acquisition or debt incurred in acquiring or improving a property,
        (ii) debt incurred before

        or improvement and (iii)
        debt incurred after the acquisition or improvement of any property if (x) the debt would not have been incurred
        but for such acquisition
        or improvement and (y) the incurrence of the debt was reasonably foreseeable at the time of the acquisition or
        improvement. The calculation
        of a particular tax-exempt organization&rsquo;s UBTI is also affected if it incurs indebtedness to finance its
        investment in a partnership.</P>

        Shareholders will depend on the nature of the Fund&rsquo;s future operations. It is possible that the Fund will
        be treated as engaged

        In general, a non-U.S.

        respect of its income
        from a U.S. trade or business may subsequently be precluded from claiming deductions related to such income. The
        Fund will be required
        to withhold at the highest applicable U.S. federal income tax rates on the share of any ECI, less allocable
        deductions, allocable to Non-U.S.
        Shareholders. To the extent that the amount of tax withheld exceeds the non-U.S. Shareholder&rsquo;s substantive

        1474 of the Code and
        the Treasury Regulations issued thereunder (commonly referred to as &ldquo;FATCA&rdquo;), a 30% withholding tax
        is imposed on payments
        of certain U.S.-source income (including interest and dividends) to non-U.S. entities unless such non-U.S.
        persons comply with certain
        reporting requirements regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners and other &ldquo;U.S. account
        holders.&rdquo; Such withholding
        could apply to payments made by the Fund to certain of its Non-U.S. Shareholders. Accordingly, Non-U.S.
        Shareholders may have to provide
        certain information, representations and waivers of non-U.S. law as may be required by the Investment Adviser to
        comply with such new
        rules in order to avoid such withholding tax, including, for example, information relating to a Non-U.S.
        Shareholder and its &ldquo;substantial
        United States owners&rdquo; (within the meaning of Code Section 1473(2)), if any, or persons holding a
        &ldquo;financial account&rdquo;
        (within the meaning of Code Section 1471(d)(2)) with such Non-U.S. Shareholder. Certain countries have entered
        into inter-governmental
        agreements with the United States to facilitate the type of information reporting required under FATCA. While
        the existence of such agreements
        will not eliminate the risk of FATCA withholding on payments made by the Fund to its Non-U.S. Shareholders,
        these agreements are expected
        to reduce the risk of the withholding for investors in (or indirectly holding interests in the Fund through
        financial institutions in)
        those countries. Potential investors are encouraged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the possible
        implications of FATCA on
        an investment in the Fund. While withholding under FATCA would also have applied to payments of gross proceeds
        from dispositions of certain
        stocks and debt instruments after December 31, 2018, proposed Regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on gross
        proceeds payments. Taxpayers
        generally may rely on such proposed Regulations until final Regulations are issued. In addition, pursuant to
        these rules, the Fund may
        provide to its advisors identifying information about the Shareholders and their participation in the Fund and
        the Fund&rsquo;s income,
        gain, loss or deduction from those transactions or investments, and the Fund or its advisors may disclose this

        Regulation provides that, if a Plan acquires an &ldquo;equity interest&rdquo; (such as Shares of the Fund) in an
        entity (such as the Fund)
        that is neither a &ldquo;publicly-offered security&rdquo; nor a security issued by an investment company

    <P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Plan Assets Regulation
        defines a &ldquo;publicly-offered
        security&rdquo; as a security that is &ldquo;widely held,&rdquo; &ldquo;freely transferable,&rdquo; and either
        part of a class of securities
        registered under the Exchange Act or sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities
        Act if the securities are
        registered under the Exchange Act within 120 days after the end of the fiscal year of the issuer during which
        the public offering occurred.
        A security is considered &ldquo;widely held&rdquo; if it is part of a class of securities that is owned by 100
        or more investors independent
        of the issuer and of one another. However, a security will not fail to be &ldquo;widely held&rdquo; solely
        because the number of independent
        investors falls below 100 subsequent to the initial public offering as a result of events beyond the
        issuer&rsquo;s control. The Plan
        Assets Regulation provides that whether a security is &ldquo;freely transferable&rdquo; is a factual question to
        be determined on the
        basis of all relevant facts and circumstances. It is noted that the Plan Assets Regulation only establishes a
        presumption in favor of
        the finding of free transferability where the restrictions are consistent with the particular types of
        restrictions listed in the Plan
        Assets Regulation.</P>

        sufficient to cause Shares to be
        a &ldquo;publicly-offered security&rdquo; for purposes of the Plan Assets Regulation), the Fund intends to use
        commercially reasonable

        Prospective investors will be required to represent whether they are, or are not and will not be, a Benefit Plan

        managed by the Investment Adviser. BDCs are required, for example, to invest at least 70% of their total assets

        of U.S. private or thinly traded public companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other
        high-quality debt instruments

        effect on the performance of
        the Fund. The individuals may not necessarily continue to remain employed by the Investment Adviser during the
        entire life of the Fund.
        If these individuals do not maintain their existing relationships with the Investment Adviser and Investment
        Adviser does not develop
        new relationships with other sources of investment opportunities available to the Fund, it may not be able to
        grow its investment portfolio.
        In addition, individuals with whom the senior professionals of the Investment Adviser have relationships are not

        the Fund with investment opportunities. Therefore, the Fund can offer no assurance that such relationships will
        generate investment opportunities

        with Other Accounts, and the relationship with such Other Accounts could influence the decisions made by the
        Investment Adviser with respect
        to such investments. The Fund may invest in securities of the same issuers as Other Accounts. To the extent that
        the Fund holds interests
        that are different (or more senior or junior) than those held by such Other Accounts, the Investment Adviser may
        be presented with decisions
        involving circumstances where the interests of such Other Accounts are in conflict with those of the Fund.
        Further conflicts could arise
        after the Fund and Other Accounts have made their respective initial investments. For example, if additional
        financing is necessary as
        a result of financial or other difficulties, it may not be in the best interests of the Fund to provide such
        additional financing. If
        the Other Accounts were to lose their respective investments as a result of such difficulties, the ability of
        the Investment Adviser to
        recommend actions in the best interests of the Fund might be impaired. The Investment Adviser may in its
        discretion take steps to reduce
        the potential for adversity between the Fund and the Other Accounts, including causing the Fund and/or such
        Other Accounts to take certain
        actions that, in the absence of such conflict, it would not take. Such conflicts will be more difficult if the
        Fund and Other Accounts
        hold significant or controlling interests in competing or different tranches of a portfolio company&rsquo;s

        it is possible the Fund&rsquo;s interest may be subordinated or otherwise adversely affected by virtue of such

        take any particular action

        at a time when such sales may be disadvantageous to the Fund in order to repay a portion of its indebtedness.
        Also, any amounts that the
        Fund uses to service its indebtedness would not be available for distributions to Shareholders. If the Fund

    <P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The use of leverage
        magnifies the potential for
        gain or loss on amounts invested. The use of leverage is generally considered a speculative investment technique
        and increases the risks
        associated with investing in the Shares. However, the Fund may in the future borrow from banks, insurance
        companies and other lenders.
        Lenders of these funds will have fixed dollar claims on the Fund&rsquo;s assets that are superior to the claims
        of Shareholders, and the
        Fund would expect such lenders to seek recovery against the Fund&rsquo;s assets in the event of a default. The
        Fund may pledge up to 100%
        of its assets and may grant a security interest in all of its assets under the terms of any debt instruments the
        Fund may enter into with
        lenders. In addition, under the terms of a borrowing facility or other debt instrument the Fund may enter into,
        it is likely to be required
        to use the net proceeds of any investments that the Fund sells to repay a portion of the amount borrowed under
        such facility or instrument
        before applying such net proceeds to any other uses. If the value of the Fund&rsquo;s assets decreases,
        leveraging would cause net asset
        value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had the Fund not leveraged, thereby magnifying losses
        or eliminating the Fund&rsquo;s
        stake in a leveraged investment. Similarly, any decrease in the Fund&rsquo;s revenue or income will cause the
        Fund&rsquo;s net income
        to decline more sharply than it would have had the Fund not borrowed. Such a decline would also negatively
        affect the Fund&rsquo;s ability
        to make dividend payments on the Shares or preferred shares. The Fund&rsquo;s ability to service any debt will
        depend largely on the Fund&rsquo;s
        financial performance and will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and competitive pressures. In
        addition, the Shareholders will
        bear the burden of any increase in the Fund&rsquo;s expenses as a result of the Fund&rsquo;s use of leverage,
        including interest expenses.</P>

        Fund&rsquo;s borrowings and
        any preferred shares that the Fund may issue in the future, of at least 150%. If this ratio declines below 150%,
        the Fund will not be
        able to incur additional debt and could be required to sell a portion of its investments to repay some debt when
        it is otherwise disadvantageous
        for the Fund to do so. This could have a material adverse effect on the Fund&rsquo;s operations, and the Fund
        may not be able to make
        distributions. The amount of leverage that the Fund employs will depend on the Investment Adviser&rsquo;s and
        the Board&rsquo;s assessment
        of market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. The Fund cannot assure you that it will be
        able to obtain credit at

        In periods of rising interest rates, the Fund&rsquo;s cost of capital would increase, which could reduce the

        violate the 1940 Act provisions applicable to BDCs. As a result of such violation, specific rules under the 1940

    <P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Fund expects that many
        of its portfolio investments
        will take the form of securities that are not publicly traded. The fair value of securities and other
        investments that are not publicly
        traded may not be readily determinable, and the Fund will value these investments at fair value as determined in
        good faith by the Board,
        including to reflect significant events affecting the value of the Fund&rsquo;s investments. Most, if not all,
        of the Fund&rsquo;s investments
        (other than cash and cash equivalents) will be classified as Level 3 assets under Topic 820 of the U.S.
        Financial Accounting Standards
        Board&rsquo;s Accounting Standards Codification, as amended, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
        (&ldquo;<U>ASC Topic 820</U>&rdquo;).
        This means that the Fund&rsquo;s portfolio valuations will be based on unobservable inputs and the Investment
        Adviser&rsquo;s own assumptions
        about how market participants would price the asset or liability in question. The Fund expects that inputs into
        the determination of fair
        value of its portfolio investments will require significant management judgment or estimation. Even if
        observable market data are available,
        such information may be the result of consensus pricing information or broker quotes, which include a disclaimer
        that the broker would
        not be held to such a price in an actual transaction. The non-binding nature of consensus pricing and/or quotes
        accompanied by disclaimers
        materially reduces the reliability of such information. The Fund expects to retain the services of one or more
        independent service providers
        to review the valuation of these loans and securities. The types of factors that the Board may take into account
        in determining the fair
        value of the Fund&rsquo;s investments generally include, as appropriate, comparison to publicly-traded
        securities including such factors
        as yield, maturity and measures of credit quality, the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and
        realizable value of any
        collateral, the portfolio company&rsquo;s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow,
        the markets in which the
        portfolio company does business and other relevant factors. Because such valuations, and particularly valuations
        of private securities
        and private companies, are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on
        estimates, the Fund&rsquo;s
        determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market
        for these loans and securities
        existed. The Fund&rsquo;s net asset value could be adversely affected if its determinations regarding the fair
        value of its investments
        were materially higher than the values that the Fund ultimately realizes upon the disposal of such loans and
        securities. In addition,
        the method of calculating the management fee may result in conflicts of interest between the Investment Adviser,
        on the one hand, and
        the Shareholders of the Fund on the other hand, with respect to valuation of investments.</P>

        interconnected, events that once
        had only local impact are now more likely to have regional or even global effects. Events that occur in one
        country, region or financial
        market will, more frequently, adversely impact issuers in other countries, regions or markets, including in
        established markets such as
        the United States. These impacts can be exacerbated by failures of governments and societies to adequately
        respond to an emerging event
        or threat.</P>

        and early 2020, a novel
        coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and related respiratory disease (COVID-19) emerged in China and spread rapidly across
        the world, including to
        the United States. This outbreak has led and for an unknown period of time will continue to lead to disruptions
        in local, regional, national
        and global markets and economies affected thereby. With respect to the U.S. credit markets (in particular for
        broadly syndicated loans),
        this outbreak has resulted in, and until fully resolved is likely to continue to result in, the following among
        other things: (i) government
        imposition of various forms of &ldquo;stay at home&rdquo; orders and the closing of &ldquo;non-essential&rdquo;
        businesses, resulting
        in significant disruption to the businesses of many middle-market loan borrowers including supply chains, demand
        and practical aspects
        of their operations, as well as in lay-offs of employees, and, while these effects may be temporary, some
        effects could be persistent
        or even permanent; (ii) increased draws by borrowers on revolving lines of credit; (iii) increased requests by
        borrowers for amendments
        and waivers of their credit agreements to avoid default, increased defaults by such borrowers and/or increased
        difficulty in obtaining
        refinancing at the maturity dates of their loans; (iv) volatility and disruption of these markets including
        greater volatility in pricing
        and spreads and difficulty in valuing loans during periods of increased volatility, and liquidity issues; and
        (v) rapidly evolving proposals
        and/or actions by state and federal governments to address problems being experienced by the markets and by
        businesses and the economy
        in general which will not necessarily adequately address the problems facing the loan market and middle market
        businesses. This outbreak
        is having, and any future outbreaks could have, an adverse impact on the markets and the economy in general,
        which could have a material
        adverse impact on, among other things, the ability of lenders to originate loans, the volume and type of loans
        originated, and the volume
        and type of amendments and waivers granted to borrowers and remedial actions taken in the event of a borrower
        default, each of which could
        negatively impact the amount and quality of loans available for investment by the Fund and returns to investors,
        among other things. As
        of the date of this Registration Statement, it is impossible to determine the scope of this outbreak, or any
        future outbreaks, how long
        any such outbreak, market disruption or uncertainties may last, the effect any governmental actions will have or
        the full potential impact

        smaller and middle market companies
        in which the Fund may invest can be significantly impacted by emerging events and the uncertainty caused by
        these events. With respect
        to loans to such companies, the Fund will be impacted if, among other things, (i) amendments and waivers are

        have experienced extreme
        volatility and disruption following the global outbreak of COVID-19 that began in December 2019. Some economists
        and major investment
        banks have expressed concern that the continued spread of the virus globally could lead to a world-wide economic
        downturn. Disruptions
        in the capital markets have increased the spread between the yields realized on risk-free and higher risk
        securities, resulting in illiquidity
        in parts of the capital markets. These and future market disruptions and/or illiquidity would be expected to
        have an adverse effect on
        the Fund&rsquo;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Unfavorable economic
        conditions also would be expected
        to increase the Fund&rsquo;s funding costs, limit its access to the capital markets or result in a decision by
        lenders not to extend credit
        to the Fund. These events have limited and could continue to limit the Fund&rsquo;s investments, limit the
        Fund&rsquo;s ability to grow
        and have a material negative impact on its operating results and the fair values of its investments.</P>

    <P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Portfolio companies may face
        intense competition,
        including competition from companies with greater financial resources, more extensive development,
        manufacturing, marketing and other
        capabilities, or a larger number of qualified managerial and technical personnel. As a result, portfolio
        companies which the Investment
        Adviser expects to be stable may operate at a loss or have significant variations in operating results, may
        require substantial additional
        capital to support their operations or to maintain their competitive position or may otherwise have a weak
        financial condition or be experiencing
        financial distress.</P>

    <P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Portfolio companies may
        issue certain types of
        debt, such as senior loans, mezzanine or high yield in connection with leveraged acquisitions or
        recapitalizations in which the portfolio
        company incurs a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which it had previously operated.
        Leverage may have important
        consequences to these portfolio companies and the Fund as an investor. For example, the substantial indebtedness
        of a portfolio company
        could (i) limit its ability to borrow money for its working capital, capital expenditures, debt service
        requirements, strategic initiatives
        or other purposes; (ii) require it to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to the
        repayment of its indebtedness,
        thereby reducing funds available to it for other purposes; (iii) make it more highly leveraged than some of its
        competitors, which may
        place it at a competitive disadvantage; or (iv) subject it to restrictive financial and operating covenants,
        which may preclude it from
        favorable business activities or the financing of future operations or other capital needs.</P>

        company&rsquo;s income and

        addition, a portfolio company
        with a leveraged capital structure will be subject to increased exposure to adverse economic factors, such as a
        significant rise in interest
        rates, a severe downturn in the economy or deterioration in the condition of that portfolio company or its
        industry. If a portfolio company
        is unable to generate sufficient cash flow to meet all of its obligations, it may take alternative measures
        (e.g., reduce or delay capital
        expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital, or seek to restructure, extend or refinance indebtedness).
        These actions may negatively

        deterioration in the

        Fund may have obtained
        in connection with the Fund&rsquo;s investment. Smaller leveraged companies also may have less predictable

        their business, MHC
        portfolio companies are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims. They typically record a reserve
        for estimated future
        warranty costs relating to homes sold, based upon their assessment of historical experience factors.
        Construction defect claims may arise
        after a significant period of time after product completion. Although they maintain general liability insurance
        and reserves for such
        claims, there can be no assurance that warranty and construction defect claims will remain at current levels or
        that such reserves will
        continue to be adequate. A large number of warranty and construction defect claims exceeding current levels
        could have a material adverse
        effect on an MHC portfolio company&rsquo;s results of operations, which would negatively impact the Fund&rsquo;s
        investment in it.</P>

        among businesses or industries
        and the cost of converting a previously adapted space to general use. An industrial property may be more likely
        to have one or only a
        few tenants, which increases the risk that a decline in their operations or their particular business or
        industry segments may adversely
        affect the returns from the property.</P>

    <P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Industrial properties
        typically have short-term
        leases, which may increase the risk of vacancies. Additionally, a property designed for a particular use or
        function may be difficult
        to relet to another tenant or may become functionally obsolete compared to other properties. Particular uses of
        industrial properties
        may increase their risk of environmental problems.</P>

    <P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In addition, because of
        unique construction requirements
        of many industrial properties, many vacant industrial property spaces may not be easily converted to other uses.
        Thus, if the operations
        of any industrial property becomes unprofitable, the liquidation value of that industrial property may be
        substantially less than would
        be the case if the industrial property were readily adaptable to other uses.</P>

        over a ten year period.
        There is a risk that at the time of the projected sale, the marketplace may be different than projected, which
        may require that a property
        be held longer than anticipated, or sold at a loss. Despite the Investment Adviser&rsquo;s projections, a
        Shareholder should be prepared
        to leave their investment with the Fund for an extended period of time.</P>

        fully insured or not economically
        insurable. This may result in insurance coverage that, in the event of a substantial loss, would not be
        sufficient to pay the full prevailing
        market value or prevailing replacement cost of each property. Inflation, changes in building codes and
        ordinances, environmental considerations,
        and other factors also might make it unfeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after the
        property has been damaged or
        destroyed. Under such circumstances, the insurance proceeds received might not be adequate to restore that
        property.</P>

        unavailable or cost-prohibitive.
        The multifamily residence portfolio company may proceed without insurance coverage for certain extraordinary
        risks if it cannot secure
        an appropriate policy or if the multifamily residence portfolio company believes that the cost of the policy is

        intends that the Fund be
        treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and not as an &ldquo;association&rdquo; or
        &ldquo;publicly traded partnership&rdquo;
        taxable as a corporation. If the Fund were treated as an &ldquo;association&rdquo; or &ldquo;publicly traded
        partnership&rdquo; taxable
        as a corporation, the Fund would be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax (and applicable state and local
        taxes) on its taxable
        income, and the income and expenses of the Fund would not be reportable by the Shareholders. Distributions from
        the Fund would be taxable
        to Shareholders as dividends to the extent of the earnings and profits of the Fund.</P>

    <P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

    <P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Under Section 7704 of the
        Code, a &ldquo;publicly
        traded partnership&rdquo; is generally treated and taxed as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
        A partnership is a publicly
        traded partnership if (i) interests in the partnership are traded on an established securities market or (ii)
        interests in the partnership
        are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof. Applicable Treasury
        regulations create certain safe
        harbor standards which, if satisfied, generally preclude classification as a publicly traded partnership. It is
        not clear that the Fund
        will be able to satisfy one or more safe harbors. Failure to satisfy a safe harbor provision will not cause the
        Fund to be treated as
        a publicly traded partnership if, taking into account all facts and circumstances, the Shareholders are not
        readily able to buy, sell
        or exchange their interests in a manner that is comparable, economically, to trading on an established
        securities market, but there is
        no assurance that the IRS would not contend that any share repurchase program if established by the Fund would
        be comparable, economically,
        to trading on an established securities market if there are significant repurchases in a given year.</P>

    <P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">If the Fund were treated as
        a publicly traded
        partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Fund generally would nonetheless remain taxable as a
        partnership if 90% or more
        of the Fund&rsquo;s gross income for each taxable year in which the Fund were a publicly traded partnership
        consisted of &quot;qualifying
        income.&quot;</P>

    <P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">To the extent the Fund is
        treated as a partnership
        for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Shareholders will be required to report their share of the Fund&rsquo;s
        income, gains, expenses,
        losses and credits on their U.S. federal and state income tax returns, without regard to the amount of
        distributions received from the
        Fund. In addition, the Fund&rsquo;s items of income may include amounts accrued by the Fund before corresponding
        payments are made to
        the Fund, and various items of Fund expense may be nondeductible by certain (generally non-corporate)
        Shareholders. As a result, a Shareholder&rsquo;s
        tax liability attributable to the Fund for any year may exceed the amount of cash distributed to that
        Shareholder for that year, so that
        Shareholders may have to fund tax liabilities attributable to the Fund from other sources.</P>

    <P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In IRS audits of the Fund,
        the tax treatment of
        Fund-related items is determined at the Fund level rather than at the Shareholder level. The Investment Adviser
        will designate itself
        or another person as the Fund&rsquo;s &ldquo;partnership representative&rdquo; with the authority to determine
        the Fund&rsquo;s response
        to an audit and to make all related decisions and elections. Under the generally applicable rules, the Fund,
        rather than the Shareholders,
        generally will be required to pay any imputed underpayments, including interest and penalties, resulting from an
        adjustment to the Fund&rsquo;s
        items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit, or an adjustment to the allocation of such items among the
        Shareholders. Such imputed
        underpayments will be based on the highest individual or corporate income tax rate in effect for the year being
        audited, unless the Fund
        is able to establish that the underpayment is allocable to a tax-exempt partner or would have otherwise been
        taxed at a lower rate. In
        such cases, a Shareholder could bear tax liabilities attributable to adjustments to a year in which it was not a
        Shareholder or in which
        its interest in the Fund were smaller. The Fund will treat any imputed underpayments as a deemed distribution to
        the Shareholder to which
        such imputed underpayment is allocable and may require former Shareholders and their successors to indemnify the
        Fund and its Shareholders
        against imputed underpayments allocable to them. As an alternative to paying the imputed underpayment, the Fund
        may elect to cause each
        person who was a Shareholder in the Fund taxable year under audit to take into account its share of any
        adjustment; however, in that case,
        the Shareholders would be subject to a higher rate of interest with respect to any underpayment than would have
        applied if the Fund were
        subject to the underpayment. Any actions taken by the Fund&rsquo;s partnership representative would be binding
        on the Fund and the Shareholders.
        The IRS will not be required to provide notice of any audit or proceeding to any other Shareholders. There can
        be no assurance that the
        Fund&rsquo;s or a Shareholder&rsquo;s tax return will not be audited by the IRS or that no adjustments to such
        returns will be made as
        a result of such an audit. Potential investors are encouraged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the
        possible implications of
        the partnership audit rules on an investment in the Fund.</P>

        otherwise exempt from
        U.S. federal income tax, such as a qualified retirement plan or an individual retirement account, generally is
        nonetheless subject to
        taxation with respect to its unrelated business taxable income, or UBTI. Except as noted below with respect to
        certain categories of exempt
        income, UBTI generally includes income or gain derived (either directly or through a partnership (such as the
        Fund)) from a trade or business,
        the conduct of which is substantially unrelated to the exercise or performance of the organization&rsquo;s
        exempt purpose or function.
        UBTI generally does not include passive investment income, such as dividends, interest and capital gains,
        whether realized by the organization
        directly or indirectly through a partnership (such as the Fund) in which it is a partner. However, if a
        tax-exempt entity&rsquo;s acquisition
        of its Units is debt financed or the partnership incurs &ldquo;acquisition indebtedness,&rdquo; all or a portion
        of the income or gain
        attributable to the &ldquo;debt financed property&rdquo; would also be included in UBTI, regardless of whether
        such income would otherwise
        be excluded as dividends, interest or capital gains.</P>

        Statement concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Fund are based upon
        existing law and the interpretations

        Fund will not be modified
        by legislative, judicial or administrative changes, possibly with retroactive effect, to the detriment of the
        Fund and the Shareholders.
        Many of the changes in the tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act applicable to
        non-corporate taxpayers were
        temporary and will no longer apply in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025 unless legislatively
        extended. INVESTORS ARE URGED
        TO CONSULT WITH THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND AND THE IMPACT OF ANY POSSIBLE
        CHANGES TO U.S. FEDERAL
        INCOME TAX LAWS ON SUCH INVESTMENT. Non-U.S. tax laws are also subject to frequent change and can be subject to
        differing interpretations.
        Changes to, or differing interpretation of, taxation laws in any of the countries in which the Fund&rsquo;s
        assets are located could result
        in some or all of the Fund&rsquo;s revenues or receipts being subject to income tax at rates and in
        circumstances not anticipated at the

        new taxation rules will
        not be enacted or that existing rules will not be applied in a manner which could result in the Fund&rsquo;s
        profits being subject to
        income tax, or increased income tax, which could have a material adverse effect on the Fund.</P>

        number of suitable investment opportunities to allow it to deploy the proceeds of subscriptions successfully. As
        a result, you will be
        unable to evaluate any future portfolio company investments prior to purchasing the Shares. Additionally, the
        Investment Adviser will
        select the Fund&rsquo;s investments subsequent to the closing of this offering, and the Shareholders will have
        no input with respect to
        such investment decisions. These factors increase the uncertainty, and thus the risk, of investing in the

        subscription in whole or in part.

        by the Board and
        in accordance with the 1940 Act, the Fund will value investments for which market quotations are readily
        available at such market quotations.
        Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available will be
        valued at fair value,
        subject at all times to the oversight and approval of the Board. Such determination of fair values may involve
        subjective judgments and
        estimates, although the Fund will also engage independent valuation providers to review the valuation of each
        portfolio investment that
        constitutes a material portion of the Fund&rsquo;s portfolio and that does not have a readily available market
        quotation at least once
        annually. With respect to unquoted securities, the Investment Adviser, together with any independent valuation
        advisors, and subject at
        all times to the oversight and approval of the Board, will value each investment considering, among other
        measures, discounted cash flow
        models, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public and other factors. The Fund intends to
        retain one or more independent
        providers of financial advisory services to assist the Investment Adviser and the Board by performing certain
        limited third-party valuation
        services. The Fund may appoint additional or different third-party valuation firms in the future.</P>

    <P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">When an external event such
        as a purchase transaction,
        public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs with respect to a fair-valued portfolio company or comparable
        company, the Board will
        use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate and/or assist the Fund in its valuation. Because
        the Fund expects that
        there will not be a readily available market for many of the investments in its portfolio, the Fund expects to
        value many of its portfolio
        investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board using a documented valuation policy and a
        consistently applied valuation
        process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily
        available market value,
        the fair value of the Fund&rsquo;s investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been
        used had readily available
        market quotations existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.</P>

        management processes employed
        by the Investment Adviser as part of its day-to-day management of the Fund&rsquo;s investment activities. The
        Board anticipates reviewing
        risk management processes at both regular and special board meetings throughout the year, consulting with
        appropriate representatives
        of the Investment Adviser as necessary and periodically receiving or requesting the production of risk
        management reports or presentations.
        The Board&rsquo;s risk oversight function is designed to ensure that the risks associated with the Fund&rsquo;s
        investment activities
        are accurately identified, thoroughly investigated and appropriately addressed. Investors should note, however,
        that the Board&rsquo;s
        oversight function cannot eliminate all risks or ensure that particular events do not adversely affect the value
        of the Fund&rsquo;s investments.</P>

        The Fund is aware of the potential conflicts that may arise when a non-Independent Trustee is Chairman of the
        Board, but believe these
        potential conflicts are mitigated by the Fund&rsquo;s strong corporate governance practices. The Fund&rsquo;s
        corporate governance practices
        include regular meetings of the Independent Directors in executive session without the presence of Interested
        Trustees and management,
        the establishment of an Audit Committee, which is comprised solely of Independent Trustees, and the appointment
        of a Chief Compliance
        Officer, with whom the Independent Trustees meet without the presence of interested trustees and other members
        of management, for administering

        Mr. Moore&rsquo;s relationship with the Investment Adviser provides an effective liaison between the Board and
        management, and encourages
        an open dialogue between management and the Board, ensuring that these groups act with a common purpose. The
        Board believes that its leadership
        structure is appropriate because the structure allocates areas of responsibility among the individual trustees
        and the committees in a
        manner that enhances effective oversight. The Board also believes that its small size creates an efficient
        corporate governance structure
        that provides opportunity for direct communication and interaction between management, the Investment Adviser
        and the Board.</P>

            profiting from the Dot Com bubble
            implosion and the Great Financial Crisis. The fund grew its assets from $2 million to over $2 billion in
            assets under management through
            contrarian and asymmetric investments in Russian equities post default, shorting the subprime housing bubble

            default swap protection, and betting on the widening of credit swap spreads in troubled European countries
            such as Greece and Portugal.

        of interest in managing the underlying investments, to the extent that an investment decision that benefits one
        fund or account (including
        the Fund) may disadvantage another. For example, it may be in the best interest of a co-investing fund or
        account to sell an investment
        while being in the best interest of the Fund to continue to hold it (and vice versa). In addition, investments
        by the Fund alongside other
        funds may result in the incurrence of additional investment expense and delays as a result of the greater
        structural complexity faced

        the same issuer that are

        the differing investment programs and projected investment horizons of the Fund and the investment accounts

        interest with respect to allocations of expenses among the Fund, other funds and accounts, and the Investment
        Adviser. When the Fund co-invests
        alongside other Investment Adviser funds or accounts in an investment, it is expected that the fees and expenses
        incurred in connection
        with such investment to the participating investing vehicles will be allocated pro rata based on their
        investment size. However, if the
        transaction is abandoned or otherwise ultimately not consummated, fees and expenses incurred in connection with
        such &ldquo;broken deal&rdquo;
        will be allocated among the Fund and the other investment vehicles that were considering the investment based on
        the expected participation
        levels of the investing funds and/or accounts. This determination is necessarily subjective, especially when a
        transaction is terminated
        at a particularly early stage. Wellings Affiliates will also face conflicts of interests in determining how to
        allocate costs and expenses
        incurred for the benefit of more than one Investment Adviser fund and/or account or Investment Adviser, itself
        (e.g., expenses incurred
        in obtaining, developing or maintaining technology systems and other software and expenses of firm-wide
        insurance policies). The aggregate

        to perform its duties to the Fund. However, the Investment Adviser&rsquo;s employees or associated persons,

        Fund&rsquo;s investing activities,
        it will pay management and incentive fees to the Investment Adviser. The Fund has entered into an Investment
        Advisory Agreement with the
        Investment Adviser. The base management fee is based on the Fund&rsquo;s average gross assets and the incentive
        fee is computed and paid
        on income and capital gains, both of which include leverage. Because these fees are based on the Fund&rsquo;s
        average gross assets, the
        Investment Adviser benefits when the Fund incurs debt or uses leverage. Under certain circumstances, the use of
        leverage may increase
        the likelihood of default, which would disfavor Shareholders. Additionally, the incentive fee payable by the
        Fund to the Investment Adviser
        may create an incentive for the Investment Adviser to cause the Fund to realize capital gains or losses that may
        not be in the best interests
        of the Fund or the Shareholders. Under the incentive fee structure, the Investment Adviser benefits when the
        Fund recognizes capital gains
        and, because the Investment Adviser determines when an investment is sold, the Investment Adviser controls the
        timing of the recognition
        of such capital gains. The Board is charged with protecting the Shareholders&rsquo; interests by monitoring how
        the Investment Adviser
        addresses these and other conflicts of interest associated with its management services and compensation.</P>

        terms of classified or reclassified Shares, and subject to the express terms of any class or series of preferred
        shares, the holders of
        the Shares will possess exclusive voting power. There will be no cumulative voting in the election of trustees.
        Subject to the special
        rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred shares to elect trustees, each trustee will be elected
        by a plurality of the
        votes cast with respect to such trustee&rsquo;s election except in the case of a &ldquo;contested
        election,&rdquo; in which case trustees
        will be elected by a majority of the votes cast in the contested election of trustees. Pursuant to the
        Declaration of Trust, the Board
        may amend the bylaws to alter the vote required to elect trustees.</P>

        not include an offering
        of preferred shares. However, under the terms of the Declaration of Trust, the Fund&rsquo;s Board may authorize
        the Fund to issue preferred
        shares in one or more classes or series without shareholder approval, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act.
        The Board has the power
        to fix the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends
        and other distributions,
        qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of each class or series of preferred shares. The Fund does
        not currently anticipate
        issuing preferred shares in the near future. In the event the Fund issues preferred shares, it will make any
        required disclosure to Shareholders.
        The Fund will not offer preferred shares to the Investment Adviser or its affiliates except on the same terms as
        offered to all other
        Shareholders.</P>

    <P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Preferred shares could be
        issued with terms that
        would adversely affect the Shareholders, provided that the Fund may not issue any preferred shares that would
        limit or subordinate the
        voting rights of holders of the Fund&rsquo;s Shares. Preferred shares could also be used as an anti-takeover
        device through the issuance
        of shares of a class or series of preferred shares with terms and conditions which could have the effect of
        delaying, deferring or preventing
        a transaction or a change in control. Every issuance of preferred shares will be required to comply with the
        requirements of the 1940
        Act. The 1940 Act requires, among other things, that immediately after issuance and before any dividend or other
        distribution is made
        with respect to Shares and before any purchase of Shares is made, such preferred shares together with all other
        senior securities must
        not exceed an amount equal to 50% of the Fund&rsquo;s total assets after deducting the amount of such dividend,
        distribution or purchase
        price, as the case may be. Certain matters under the 1940&nbsp;Act require the affirmative vote of the holders
        of at least a majority
        of the outstanding shares of preferred shares (as determined in accordance with the 1940 Act) voting together as
        a separate class. For
        example, the vote of such holders of preferred shares would be required to approve a proposal involving a plan
        of reorganization adversely
        affecting such securities.</P>

                                Section 5.1
                                <U>No Personal Liability of Shareholders, Trustees, etc</U>. No Shareholder of the Trust
                                shall be subject in such capacity to any personal
                                liability whatsoever to any Person in connection with Trust Property or the acts,
                                obligations or affairs of the Trust. Shareholders shall
                                have the same limitation of personal liability as is extended to stockholders of a
                                private corporation for profit incorporated under the
                                Delaware General Corporation Law. No Trustee or officer of the Trust shall be subject in
                                such capacity to any personal liability whatsoever
                                to any Person, save only liability to the Trust or its Shareholders arising from bad
                                faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence or reckless
                                disregard for his duty to such Person; and, subject to the foregoing exception, all such
                                Persons shall look solely to the Trust Property
                                for satisfaction of claims of any nature arising in connection with the affairs of the
                                Trust. If any Shareholder, Trustee or officer,
                                as such, of the Trust, is made a party to any suit or proceeding to enforce any such
                                liability, subject to the foregoing exception, he
                                shall, on account thereof, be held harmless with respect to any personal liability. Any
                                repeal or modification of this Section 5.1 shall
                                not adversely affect any right or protection of a Trustee or officer of the Trust

                                The Trust hereby agrees to indemnify each

                                conduct was unlawful, provided, however,
                                that no indemnitee shall be indemnified hereunder against any liability to any person or
                                any expense of such indemnitee arising by

                                such register shall be conclusive as to who are the holders of the Shares of the

                                that certificates will be issued for the Shares; however, the Trustees, in their
                                discretion, may authorize the issuance of share certificates
                                and promulgate appropriate fees therefore and rules and regulations as to their use.

                                proxy, provided that no proxy shall be voted at any meeting unless it shall have been
                                placed on file with the Secretary, or with such
                                other officer or agent of the Trust as the Secretary may direct, for verification prior
                                to the time at which such vote shall be taken.
                                Pursuant to a resolution of a majority of the Trustees, proxies may be solicited in the
                                name of one or more Trustees or one or more of
                                the officers or employees of the Trust. No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of
                                11 months from the date thereof, unless otherwise
                                provided in the proxy. Only Shareholders of record shall be entitled to vote. Each full
                                Share shall be entitled to one vote and fractional
                                Shares shall be entitled to a vote of such fraction. When any Share is held jointly by
                                several persons, any one of them may vote at any
                                meeting in person or by proxy in respect of such Share, but if more than one of them
                                shall be present at such meeting in person or by
                                proxy, and such joint owners or their proxies so present disagree as to any vote to be
                                cast, such vote shall not be received in respect
                                of such Share. A proxy purporting to be executed or authorized by or on behalf of a
                                Shareholder shall be deemed valid unless challenged
                                at or prior to its exercise and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the
                                challenger. If the holder of any such Share is a minor
                                or a person of unsound mind, and subject to guardianship or to the legal control of any
                                other person as regards the charge or management
                                of such Share, he may vote by his guardian or such other person appointed or having such
                                control, and such vote may be given in person
                                or by proxy.

                                <U>Inspectors of Election</U>. In advance of any meeting of Shareholders, the Trustees
                                may appoint Inspectors of Election to act at the
                                meeting or any adjournment thereof. If Inspectors of Election are not so appointed, the
                                Chairman, if any, of any meeting of Shareholders
                                may, and on the request of any Shareholder or Shareholder proxy shall, appoint
                                Inspectors of Election of the meeting. The number of Inspectors
                                of Election shall be either one or three. If appointed at the meeting on the request of
                                one or more Shareholders or proxies, a majority
                                of Shares present shall determine whether one or three Inspectors of Election are to be
                                appointed, but failure to allow such determination
                                by the Shareholders shall not affect the validity of the appointment of Inspectors of
                                Election. In case any person appointed as Inspector
                                of Election fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the vacancy may be filled by
                                appointment made by the Trustees in advance of the
                                convening of the meeting or at the meeting by the person acting as Chairman. The
                                Inspectors of Election shall determine the number of
                                Shares outstanding, the Shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum,
                                the authenticity, validity and effect of proxies,
                                shall receive votes, ballots or consents, shall hear and determine all challenges and
                                questions in any way arising in connection with
                                the right to vote, shall count and tabulate all votes or consents, determine the
                                results, and do such other acts as may be proper to conduct
                                the election or vote with fairness to all Shareholders. If there are three Inspectors of
                                Election, the decision, act or certificate of
                                a majority is effective in all respects as the decision, act or certificate of all. On
                                request of the Chairman, if any, of the meeting,
                                or of any Shareholder or Shareholder proxy, the Inspectors of Election shall make a
                                report in writing of any challenge or question or
                                matter determined by them and shall execute a certificate of any facts found by them.

                                paragraph (A) of this Section 1.4 shall be deemed satisfied
                                by a Shareholder with respect to business other than a nomination if the Shareholder has
                                notified the Trust of his, her or its intention
                                to present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with applicable rules and
                                regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act and
                                such Shareholder&rsquo;s proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been
                                prepared by the Trust to solicit proxies for such
                                annual meeting. The Trust may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other
                                information as it may reasonably require to determine
                                the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a Trustee of the Trust.</P>

                                    <TD STYLE="text-align: justify">In determining the capital gains incentive fee
                                        payable to the Investment Adviser, the Fund calculate the
                                        cumulative aggregate realized capital gains and cumulative aggregate realized
                                        capital losses since the Fund&rsquo;s inception, and the
                                        aggregate unrealized capital depreciation as of the date of the calculation, as
                                        applicable, with respect to each of the investments in
                                        the Fund&rsquo;s portfolio. For this purpose, cumulative aggregate realized
                                        capital gains, if any, equals the sum of the differences between
                                        the net sales price of each investment, when sold, and the original cost of such
                                        investment since the Fund&rsquo;s inception. Cumulative
                                        aggregate realized capital losses equals the sum of the amounts by which the net
                                        sales price of each investment, when sold, is less than
                                        the original cost of such investment since the Fund&rsquo;s inception. Aggregate
                                        unrealized capital depreciation equals the sum of the
                                        difference, if negative, between the valuation of each investment as of the
                                        applicable calculation date and the original cost of such
                                        investment. At the end of the applicable year, the amount of capital gains that
                                        serves as the basis for the Fund&rsquo;s calculation of
                                        the capital gains incentive fee equals the cumulative aggregate realized capital
                                        gains less cumulative aggregate realized capital losses,
                                        less aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, with respect to the Fund&rsquo;s

                                counsel and accountants in respect of the Fund&rsquo;s affairs and shall be fully
                                protected and justified in any action or inaction which
                                is taken in accordance with the advice or opinion of such counsel and accountants;

                                of the Board. The fee for the period from the day of the month this Agreement is entered
                                into until the end of that month shall be pro-rated
                                according to the proportion that such period bears to the full monthly period. Upon any
                                termination of this Agreement before the end of
                                any month, the fee for such part of a month shall be pro-rated according to the
                                proportion which such period bears to the full monthly
                                period and shall be payable upon the date of termination of this Agreement. Should this
                                Agreement be terminated (other than for cause
                                on the part of the Administrator) or the Fund or any Fund be liquidated, merged with or
                                acquired by another fund or investment company,
                                any accrued fees shall be immediately payable.</P>

                                after receipt by Administrator of notice of the commencement of an investigation,

                                a claim for indemnification in respect thereof is made under this Section, notify the
                                Fund in writing of the commencement thereof, although

                                brought to enforce any such Loss, but if the Fund
                                elects to assume the defense, such defense shall be conducted by counsel chosen by the
                                Fund and approved by Administrator, which approval
                                shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event the Fund elects to assume the defense

                                Administrator of such election, the indemnified defendant or defendants in such suit
                                shall bear the fees and expenses of any additional
                                counsel retained by them subsequent to the receipt of the Fund&rsquo;s election. If the
                                Fund does not elect to assume the defense of any
                                such suit, or in case Administrator does not, in the exercise of reasonable judgment,

                                there is a conflict of interest between the Fund and Administrator or any Indemnified
                                Party, the Fund will reimburse the Indemnified Party
                                or Parties named as defendant or defendants in such suit, for the reasonable fees and
                                expenses of any counsel retained by Administrator
                                and them. The Fund&rsquo;s indemnification agreement contained in this Section 7 and the
                                Fund&rsquo;s representations and warranties in
                                this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any
                                investigation made by or on behalf of Administrator
                                and each Indemnified Party, and shall survive the delivery of any Shares and the
                                termination of this Agreement. This agreement of indemnity
                                will inure exclusively to Administrator&rsquo;s benefit, to the benefit of each
                                Indemnified Party and their estates and successors. The
                                Fund agrees to promptly notify Administrator of the commencement of any litigation or
                                proceedings against the Fund or any of its officers
                                or directors in connection with the issue and sale of any of the Shares.</P>

                                In such case, the parties shall in good faith modify or substitute such provision
                                consistent with the original intent of the parties.</P>

                                fails to satisfy any of the Liabilities as and when due and payable, the Custodian shall
                                have in respect of the Collateral, in addition
                                to all other rights and remedies arising hereunder or under local law, the rights and
