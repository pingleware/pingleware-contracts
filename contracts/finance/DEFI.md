# Decentralize Finance (aka DeFi)

From the webster dictionary definition of decentralization,

    "the dispersion or distribution of functions and powers"

from investopedia,

    "Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an emerging financial technology based on secure distributed ledgers similar to those used by cryptocurrencies. The system removes the control banks and institutions have on money, financial products, and financial services."

from chain.link,

    "Decentralized finance, or “DeFi,” refers to the emerging blockchain-based ecosystem of permissionless and transparent financial services."

from cryptodefintions.com,

    "DeFi is an abbreviation for Decentralized Finance. It refers to any financial system that operates on blockchain technology. By using decentralized networks, DeFi systems can easily transform traditional financial services like banking, borrowing, and lending into permissionless, transparent networks that can run without middlemen."

from goodcrypto.app,

    "Decentralized Finance (DeFi for short) is a lot of things but one simple definition. DeFi in crypto might mean several things. First of all, it’s a community of libertarian-minded developers and startupers who aim to replace traditional banking with new distributed algorithms."

from, wikipedia,

    "Decentralized finance (DeFi) offers financial instruments without relying on intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks by using smart contracts on a blockchain..."

from coindesk.com,

    "Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications aim to cut out the middlemen of our everyday finances."

from coinbase.com,

    "Short for decentralized finance, DeFi is an umbrella term for peer-to-peer financial services on public blockchains, primarily Ethereum."


# A Problem with the above Definitions?
They all move to removing central authority, thus accountability from the finance equation and prefer a wild, wild west approach. We are already seeing the problems asociated with this mentality from uncontrollable gains that only benefit a select few, to an increased level of proliferation of scams like rug pulls.

# A New Definition of DeFi
Allowing a small entity operations to compete in the financial marketplace once dominated by the deep pockets but at a fraction of the cost.

# Regulated DeFi
Where all players are following the rules to ensure accountability and integrity is maintained in the financial marketsm which keeps an efficient market.

# Authorative Powers
The current regulations are sufficient for most DeFi businessm while some may need adjustments For example, traditionally a stock transaction is not instance and is commonly referred to as a one or two day clearance. This involves additional regulation to ensure abuses are not incorporated in the process. While on the blockchain, transfer is instance resulting in zero day clearance.

Built on Cryptography, Blockchain, and Smart Contracts

Five Pillars of DeFi

    - Stable coins
    - Borrowing and Lending (flashloans) [compound/avae platform]
    - Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) [Binance, Uniswap, Pancakeswap]
    - Insurance (with Oracles)
    - Margin Trading

## Stable Coins
SEC stated cryptocurrency is NOT a security but a commodity, https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-announces-ether-not-security-162658147.html

Commodities are still regulated by thee CFTC, see https://www.cftc.gov/digitalassets/index.htm

An exemption would be needed to eliminate the Clearing Organization registration (https://www.cftc.gov/IndustryOversight/ClearingOrganizations/index.htm), since blockchain transactions are instantenous.

Looking back at previous enforcement, https://complianceconcourse.willkie.com/articles/insights-2021-20210916-cftcpushesenforcementonoverseas

    "operating a cryptocurrency derivatives trading platform that failed to register as a swap execution facility (“SEF”), designated contract market (“DCM”), or futures commission merchant (“FCM”), and for failure to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, including a failure to implement a customer identification program (“CIP”) and know-your-customer (“KYC”) procedures.."

### Swap Execution Facility (“SEF”)
Read more at https://www.cftc.gov/IndustryOversight/TradingOrganizations/SEF2/index.htm

### Designated Contract Market (“DCM”)
Read more at https://www.cftc.gov/IndustryOversight/TradingOrganizations/DCMs/index.htm

A new DCM would need to register with the SEC using Forn 1-N, https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-44692a.pdf

DCMs may implement new rules or rule amendments by filing with the CFTC a certification that the rule or rule amendment complies with the CEA and CFTC regulations and policies and/or by requesting approval from the CFTC. By registering as a DCM who trades in cryptocurrencies, that DCM can submit amendments to rules for cryptocurency transactions.

DCM Forms https://www.cftc.gov/Forms/dcmforms.html

### Futures Commission Merchant (“FCM”)
Read more at https://www.cftc.gov/IndustryOversight/Intermediaries/FCMs/fcmsegregationfunds.html

### Implementating Customer Identification Program (“CIP”) and Know-Your-Customer (“KYC”)
Each transaction is identified by a wallet address, an off-chain correlation between wallet and personal identifying information should staisfy the Customer Identification Program. The KYC applies when a Customer first requests access to the platform.

## Borrowing and Lending
To be in compliance with lending laws, licensing is obtained at the State level, typically as a Finance Company.

## Decentralized Exchange (DEX)
The SEC permits the registration of an ATS or Alternative Trading System using Form ATS-N and requires periodic reporting.

The current list of SEC registered ATS is at https://www.sec.gov/foia/docs/atslist.htm and from INVESTOR.GOV at https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/alternative-trading-systems-atss

Form ATS-N at https://www.sec.gov//files/formats-n.pdf

Additionally, the CFTC defines two types of trading organizations for trading commodities for which a cryptocurrency (stable coin) is considered. These are Designated Contract Martkets (DCM) and Swap Execution Facility (SEF), see https://www.cftc.gov/IndustryOversight/TradingOrganizations/index.htm

A DEX without an associated cryptocurrency (using Ethereum as the base) should only need to register as an ATS, but if the DEX is offering a stable coin on their platform, a registration as a DCM with a 1-N notification may be required.

A Money Transmitter license may also be required.

A DEX using ethereum as a based, would need to include a bridge to transfer from Ethereum mainnet cryptocurrency to the private network. A DEX could attract investors to provide the revenue reserves as required by the CFTC, where earnings are made from the gas fees. To attract more participants, the gas fees must be significantly lower than the competition but not too low to loose investor interest? An 506(c) exempt public offering can be used to attract accredited investors for building a compliant regulated DEX?

### Rule 304(a)(1)(i) - Filing and effectiveness requirement.
17 CFR 242.304 ("Rule 304") and 17 CFR 242.300 through 242.303 (“Regulation ATS”)
from https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/242.304

No exemption is available to an NMS Stock ATS pursuant to § 240.3a1-1(a)(2) unless the NMS Stock ATS files with the Commission an initial Form ATS-N, in accordance with the conditions of this section, and the initial Form ATS-N is effective pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(iii) or (a)(1)(iv)(A) of this section.
