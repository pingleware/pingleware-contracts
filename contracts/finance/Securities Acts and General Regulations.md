# Investment Advisers Act of 1940
This law regulates investment advisers. With certain exceptions, this Act requires that firms or sole practitioners compensated for advising others about securities investments must register with the SEC and conform to regulations designed to protect investors. Since the Act was amended in 1996 and 2010, generally only advisers who have at least $100 million of assets under management or advise a registered investment company must register with the Commission. Other investment advisers typically register with the state in which the investment adviser maintains its principal place of business.

# Bank Secrecy Act
The Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970—which legislative framework is commonly referred to as the "Bank Secrecy Act" (BSA)—requires U.S. financial institutions to assist U.S. government agencies to detect and prevent money laundering. Specifically, the act requires financial institutions to keep records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, file reports of cash transactions exceeding $10,000 (daily aggregate amount), and to report suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion, or other criminal activities. It was passed by the Congress of the United States in 1970. The BSA is sometimes referred to as an "anti-money laundering" (AML) law or jointly as “BSA/AML." Several acts, including provisions in Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, have been enacted up to the present to amend the BSA. (See 12 USC 1829b, 12 USC 1951-19600, 31 USC 5311-5314, 5316-5336, and 31 CFR Chapter X [formerly 31 CFR Part 103].)

With respect to a customer account or customer transaction of a financial institution, if a Federal law enforcement agency, after notifying FinCEN of the intent to submit a written request to the financial institution that the financial institution keep that account or transaction open (referred to in this section as a ‘‘keep open request’’), or if a State, Tribal, or local law enforcement agency with the concurrence of FinCEN submits a keep open request—
    (1) the financial institution shall not be liable under this chapter for maintaining that account or transaction consistent with the parameters and timing of the request; and

### (c) Rule of construction 
Nothing in this section may be construed—
    (1) to prevent a Federal or State department or agency from verifying the validity of a keep open request submitted under subsection (b) with the law enforcement agency submitting that request; 
    (2) to relieve a financial institution from complying with any reporting requirements, including the reporting of suspicious transactions under section 5318(g) of title 31; or 
    (3) to extend the safe harbor described in subsection (b) to any actions taken by the financial institution—
        (A) before the date of the keep open request to maintain a customer account; or 
        (B) after the termination date stated in the keep open request. 
### (d) Letter termination date 
For the purposes of this section, any keep open request submitted under subsection (b) shall include a termination date after which that request shall no longer apply
### (e) Record keeping 
Any Federal, State, Tribal, or local law enforcement agency that submits to a financial institution a keep open request shall, not later than 2 business days after the date on which the request is submitted to the financial institution—
    (1) submit to FinCEN a copy of the request; and 
    (2) alert FinCEN as to whether the financial institution has implemented the request.
