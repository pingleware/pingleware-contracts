Let’s explore how points, leaderboards, and badges (when implemented correctly) boost motivation: (https://medium.com/googleplaydev/the-right-app-rewards-to-boost-motivation-c1ec86390450)

    Points 
            serve as indicators of achievement and progress. Points can reward users with status (if used to rank users against each other) or they can offer tangible rewards (for example, when converted to in-app currency or free items as part of a loyalty scheme).
    Badges 
            primarily serve to recognize a user’s accomplishments. Badge systems in many apps and games also help align users to shared goals while acting as virtual status symbols, distinguishing badge-holders from others.
    Leaderboards 
            indicate progress against others, framing app engagement as a competitive pursuit. Like badges, leaderboards can motivate users when they serve as visual indicators of status among other users.
