# Utility Token
A utility token can serve just about any purpose a developer wants it to. In general, utility tokens provide access to a specific service or product with a blockchain ecosystem. In other words, you might need a certain utility token to be able to perform actions on an altcoin’s network.

Utility tokens are not necessarily finace-based tokens, such as a Software License NFT is a utility token that verifies access rights and usage for a particular software application or service.

A utility does NOT pass the howey test below,

The criteria of this test are:

    Y -   A monetary investment

    Y -   People invest because they expect to make money

    N -   The investment is a “common enterprise,” meaning investors will only make money based on what the issuers of the investment do

    N -   Profits are dependent on the work of a third party

A utility token has a price to acquire, and if the utility token is hosted on an NFT Marketplace where they can freely sell their access rights to another user, a user can make money (people have been selling on ebay for decades yet the products are not securities)

The purchasers make money from the resale on the NFT marketplace not dependent on the performance of the issuers. The popularity of the issuers will have a influence on the pricing, such as a NFT assoicated with a high profile public figure will command a higher resale value than your average person. A security investment is assoicated directly with the performance of a campany
