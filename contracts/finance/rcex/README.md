(B) The term “member” when used with respect to a registered securities association means any broker or dealer who agrees to be regulated by such association and with respect to whom the association undertakes to enforce compliance with the provisions of this chapter, the rules and regulations thereunder, and its own rules.

Under 15 USC 78f(c)(3)(A) and (B) may bar or condition membership for a natural person, if such natural person (i) does not meet such standards of training, experience, and competence as are prescribed by the rules of the exchange. By default, all members of a NMS must be a registered broker-dealer, but as describe above, the NMS may provide conditional membership to natural persons that do not meet the standards of trainig, epexerience or competence including the lack of broker-dealer experience. 

This means that an **issuer** does not have to be a broker-dealer and becomes a member conditionally for only listing security offerings permitted.
