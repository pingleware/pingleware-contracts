# Commercial Paper
Commercial Paper is an exempt security and does not require registration with the SEC. Before the blockchain, commercial paper transactions have multiple layers of tracking and reporting as well as repayment which includes an IPA, CPA, and depository. The blockchain acts as the depository, and there is an immutable log of transactions, commercial paper can be bought and repaid directly between the issuer and investor. A credit rating is still required for the issuer.

Whitelisting the investors with the commercial paper contract, purchases and repayment can be accomplished at T+0 clearing using a etehreum wallet like metamask to exchange ether for commercial paper tokens and repayment is the reverse, plus interest. Interest should exceed gas fees to make this special investment vehicle more attractive to investors.

# Commercial Paper is like flash loans, but regulated
A flash loan is a loan that is only valid within one blockchain transaction. Flash loans fail, if the borrower does not repay its debt before the end of the transaction borrowing the loan. That is, because a blockchain transaction can be reverted during its execution, if the condition of a repayment is not satisfied.

Flash loans are similar to the Federal Reserve short term lending between registered banking entities but with a shorter term.
