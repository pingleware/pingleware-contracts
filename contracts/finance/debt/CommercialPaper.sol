 * The issuer is the entity issuing the commercial papers. Where the commercial papers are issued through a special purpose vehicle (SPV),

 * Licensed Securities Depository
 *
 * The Licensed Securities Depository is a specialist financial institution, licensed by the SEC,

 * that ownership can be easily transferred through a book entry rather than the transfer of physical certificates.
 * The depository acts as the registrar and the custodian of the commercial papers.

 * A depository is not needed as the commercial paper contract resides on the blockchain amd changes are still made via a book entry

 /**
  * 1. Commercial Paper is issued
  * 2. Promoter or Issuer notifies investors
  * 3. A NRSRO assigns a credit rating to the issuer
  * 4. Investors transfer amount to issuer wallet in multiples of the minimaum denomination, which is typically $100,000
  * 5. During repayment, issuer transfers repayment to the IPA, which  then transfer to the investor. Since a immutable log of transaction is maintain,
  *     the IPA can be eliminated, and repayment comes directly from the issuer wallet.
