# Asset Based Securities (ABS)
A typical debt financing is ABS, see https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/dodd-frank/assetbackedsecurities.shtm

Asset-backed securities (ABS) are created by buying and bundling loans – such as residential mortgage loans, commercial loans or student loans – and creating securities backed by those assets, which are then sold to investors. Often, a bundle of loans is divided into separate securities with different levels of risk and returns. Payments on the loans are distributed to the holders of the lower-risk, lower-interest securities first, and then to the holders of the higher-risk securities.

Most public offerings of ABS are conducted through expedited SEC registration procedures known as “shelf offerings.” ABS offerings also are sold as private placements which are exempt from SEC registration. Privately-issued ABS are typically sold to large institutional investors known as qualified institutional buyers or QIBs.

# EDGAR ABS XML Technical Specification
See https://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/specifications/absxml.htm

The ABS XML Technical Specification (Version 2.0) document describes the valid structure and content of the ABS Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) Extensible Markup Language (XML) Asset Data File types. The ABS XML Technical Specification provides a basis for creating ABS Asset Data File Types that can be successfully processed by the EDGAR system.

ABS Asset Data Files must conform to the ABS Asset Data File Taxonomy for the EDGAR system. This taxonomy comprises a collection of XML Schema Definition (.xsd) files that defines the structure of ABS Asset Data File Types. ABS Asset Data Files can be transmitted to the SEC via the ‘Transmit’ link on the EDGAR FilerWeb (https://www.edgarfiling.sec.gov/) or the “Transmit XML Submission” option from the EDGAR OnlineForms Website (https://www.onlineforms.edgarfiling.sec.gov).
