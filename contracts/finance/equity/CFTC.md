## Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO)
See https://www.cftc.gov/IndustryOversight/ClearingOrganizations/index.htm

A derivatives clearing organization (DCO) is an entity that enables each party to an agreement, contract, or transaction to substitute, through novation or otherwise, the credit of the DCO for the credit of the parties; arranges or provides, on a multilateral basis, for the settlement or netting of obligations; or otherwise provides clearing services or arrangements that mutualize or transfer credit risk among participants.

A DCO that seeks to provide clearing services with respect to futures contracts, options on futures contracts, or swaps must register with the CFTC before it can begin providing such services.  The Commission may exempt a DCO from registration for the clearing of swaps if the Commission determines that such DCO is subject to comparable, comprehensive supervision by appropriate government authorities in the DCO’s home country.

## Swap Execution Facilities (SEF)
https://www.cftc.gov/IndustryOversight/TradingOrganizations/SEF2/index.htm

Swap Execution Facilities (SEFs) are trading facilities that operate under the regulatory oversight of the CFTC, pursuant to Section 5h of the Commodity Exchange Act (“the Act”), 7 U.S.C. 7b-3. SEFs were created by the addition of Section 5h of the Act by Section 733 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) for the trading and processing of swaps. The stated goals of the Dodd-Frank Act are to promote the trading of swaps on SEFs and to promote pre-trade price transparency in the swaps market. To that end, a swap, as defined by 17 C.F.R. Part 1, can be traded on a SEF or pursuant to the rules of a SEF by Eligible Contract Participants (ECPs).
