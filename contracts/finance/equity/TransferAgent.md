A CUSIP number is needed for each offering, especially when Rule 144 is applicable?

To apply for a CUSIP number for this offering, there are prerequisites:

    - Must have a transfer agent
    - Must have an underwriter
    - Must have an attorney that prepared the Private Placement Memorandum (PPM)
    - Cost is $168 and requires a credit card

## Why is a CUSIP number needed for Equity Offerings?
When an equity offering is launch, the purpose of the equity offering is to sell stock in a company. When an investor buys equity in a company, whether through a public or private offering, they expect to receive a stock certificate. In today's world of online trading, stock certificates are no longer issued to the shareholder but their transaction is still recorded. Each stock certificate issued is associated with the an offering. To help keep track of which stock certificate is related to the offering, a CUSIP number is assigned to the offering and that CUSIP number becomes the prefix for the stock certificate number. 

In blockchain equity token transactions, the token or transaction ID or hash can be the suffix for the stock certificate issued.

For example, a new stock certificate could have a number in the format of,

    CUSIP-TOKEN_TRANSACTION_HASH|INDEX

For restricted securities, the stock certificates have a RESTRICTED image overlaid on the certtificate.

For a blockchain offering, the investor name on the stock certificate is replaced with the investor wallet address. The transfer agent maintains the correlation with investor wallet address to investor personal identifying information off-chain as well as will create the stock certificate and attached an image to the transaction.

#### Transfer Agents: Instructions for Sending Accountant's Reports and Notices of Corrective Action Pursuant to the Annual Study and Evaluation of Internal Accounting Control
See https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/ta-instructions.htm

Pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-13, every registered transfer agent, except as provided in Rule 17Ad-13(d), must annually file with the Commission a report prepared by an independent accountant concerning the transfer agent's system of internal accounting control and related procedures for the transfer of record ownership and the safeguarding of related securities and funds. For purposes of this report, the objective of a transfer agent's system of internal accounting control for the transfer of record ownership and the safeguarding of related securities and funds should be to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that securities and funds are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition and that transfer agent activities are performed promptly and accurately. The accountant's report must state, among other things, whether the study and evaluation was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and must describe any material inadequacies found by the accountant and any corrective action taken by the transfer agent. If the accountant's report describes any material inadequacy, Rule 17Ad-13(b) requires a transfer agent to notify the Commission in writing within sixty calendar days of any corrective action taken or proposed to be taken. While Rule 17Ad-13 provides general instructions for sending the report and notice to the Commission, these instructions are to provide more specific guidance. The accountant's report and corrective action notification should be directed to the attention of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Director of the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, by care of Transfer Agent Accountant Report. Additional information regarding sending accountant's reports and corrective action notices is provided below.
