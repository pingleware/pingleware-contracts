# Broker/Dealer
See https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/divisionsmarketregbdguidehtm.html

A company who sells their own securities ONLY, is exempt from Broker-Dealer registration and known as an Issuer's Exemption.

# Blockchain Equity Token Issuance
As long as the smart contract is under complete control of the issuing company, Broker-Dealer registration is NOT required.

A self-issuer offering has been equated to a no-liquidity offering, that is the investors of the offering can only hold and not resell their holdings until an IPO becomes effective and the shares are traded on a national exchange.

With blockchain and smart contracts, the self-issuer can offer limited liqidity for their direct offerings, disclosing that without a market maker, there could be and will be market inefficiencies, see https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/inefficient-market/ for more information on market inefficiencies.

Though the smart contract can be code to reduce some of the market inefficiences?
