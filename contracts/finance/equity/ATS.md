# Money Transmitter License (MTL)
A Money Transmitter License is a state regulated license and while two US-based DEX have obtained a MTL, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking made a ruling that a DEX is NOT a Money Transmitter business (https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/crypto-exchanges-are-not-money-transmitters-clarifies-pennsylvania/)

Under US law, when a state makes a law, other state must abide their ruling. Ask an attorney on lawyers.com or avvo.com to explain this?
