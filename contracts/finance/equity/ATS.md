# Alternate Trading System (ATS)

From: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alternative-trading-system.asp

    "An alternative trading system (ATS) is a trading venue that is more loosely regulated than an exchange. ATS platforms are often used to match large buy and sell orders among its subscribers. The most widely used type of ATS in the United States are electronic communication networks (ECNs)—computerized systems that automatically match buy and sell orders for securities in the market..."

If you implement the DEX Exchange contract in your and offer the platform to your investors, then you must register the DEX as an ATS, and you should seek out an experienced attorney to help with this registration. A broker-dealer license may also be required?

Currently, the ganache-cli is memory-only that is all transactions are lost when the session is ended. You will need a compliant DEX Exchange or modify the ganache-cli to save all transactions in a ledger or database.

# Money Transmitter License (MTL)

A Money Transmitter License is a state regulated license and while two US-based DEX have obtained a MTL, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking made a ruling that a DEX is NOT a Money Transmitter business (https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/crypto-exchanges-are-not-money-transmitters-clarifies-pennsylvania/)

Under US law, when a state makes a law, other state must abide their ruling. Ask an attorney on lawyers.com or avvo.com to explain this?

# FINRA ATS Reporting

See https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/4550

Since the ethereum mainnet is immutable and public while reference by the smart contract address, this report can
be created automatically. While ethereum mainnet is NOT considered an ATS, the issuer of the token is responsible for ATS reporting.

### NMS (National Market System)

The ATS by PRESSPAGE ENTERTAINMENT INC is not a NMS-ATS, as only self-issued securities will be listed on this ATS.

### Possible Exemptions

Under the Uniform Security Act, an Issuer is exempt from Broker-Dealer registration when ONLY selling their OWN securities.

PRESSPAGE ENTERTAINMENT INC dba REDEECASH quallifies for the exemption from broker-dealer registration as long as only securities of PRESSPAGE ENTERTAINMENT INC are issued and traded on the ATS. 

### Prohibitions

Paragraph 11 prohibits the use of Exchange for the ATS, this means that PRESSPAGE ENTERTAINMENT INC dba REDEECASH can not use REDEECASH.EXCHANGE domain for any reference to an ATS operations. ATS operations will be branded under REDEECASH.TRADE domain.

### Protection of Confidential Trade Information

While the completed trade transaction is public and immutable, pending trades aka order book trades are private data within the smart contract. Investors or traders are indentified by their public wallet address, but true identification is mantained off chain in accordance with 242.301(10)

### ATS is an example of DeFi

The goal of DeFi is to permit finance operations to be created separate from the centralized entities. The centralized entities in trading systems including NMS are NYSE, NASDAQ and OTC. An ATS on the block chain will permit DeFi by allowing small business to create an ATS on the block chain and issue their own securities on their ATS.
