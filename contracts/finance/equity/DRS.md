# Draft Registration Statement (DRS)
Draft registration statements may be submitted to the SEC if certain conditions are present. The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”) allows an “emerging growth company” to submit a draft of its registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and exhibits to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on a confidential basis. The most commonly used registration statement under the Securities Act is Form S-1. This blog posts addresses the common questions we receive about confidential registration statement submissions on Form S-1.
