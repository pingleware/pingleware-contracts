# Small Reporting Company (SRC) Exemptions
See https://www.sec.gov/education/smallbusiness/goingpublic/SRC

The scaled disclosure requirements for smaller reporting companies permit your company:

    to include less extensive narrative disclosure than required of other reporting companies, particularly in the description of executive compensation and
    to provide audited financial statements for two fiscal years, in contrast to other reporting companies, which must provide audited financial statements for three fiscal years 

It will be a non-accelerated filer. A non-accelerated filer is not required to provide an auditor attestation of management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting, which is generally required for SEC reporting companies under Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b), and, in contrast to other reporting companies, has more time to file its periodic reports.
