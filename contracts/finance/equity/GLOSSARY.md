## Par Value
The value of a company's stock as defined in the registration documents such as the Article of Incorporation. The par value is the minimum price that a company has deemed their equity may be sold. Placing a high par value raises the bar of valuation. Depending on the juisdiction of incorporation, a company's franchise tax liability may be affected by the par value assigned?

## Book Value
The value of a company based on their accounting records (or books) taking into consideration sales, expenses, and assets. The book value should be greater than the total par value which is the product of the total shares and par value price.

## Market Value
The value (price) of a company share that an investor will purchase shares of the company where the minimum price is determined by the par value. Also the most speculative pricing! Supply, Demand, Emotions (FMO) and Greed are drive market pricing. 

## Common Stock
From: https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/difference-between-preferred-stock-and-common-stock/

Common stock represents shares of ownership in a corporation and the type of stock in which most people invest. When people talk about stocks, they are usually referring to common stock. In fact, the great majority of stock is issued in this form.

Common shares represent a claim on profits (dividends) and confer voting rights. Investors most often get one vote per share owned to elect board members who oversee the major decisions made by management. Stockholders thus have the ability to exercise control over corporate policy and management issues compared to preferred shareholders.

## Preferred Stock
From: https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/difference-between-preferred-stock-and-common-stock/

One main difference from common stock is that preferred stock comes with no voting rights. So when it comes time for a company to elect a board of directors or vote on any form of corporate policy, preferred shareholders have no voice in the future of the company. In fact, preferred stock functions similarly to bonds since with preferred shares, investors are usually guaranteed a fixed dividend in perpetuity.

The dividend yield of a preferred stock is calculated as the dollar amount of a dividend divided by the price of the stock. This is often based on the par value before a preferred stock is offered. It's commonly calculated as a percentage of the current market price after it begins trading. This is different from common stock, which has variable dividends that are declared by the board of directors and never guaranteed. In fact, many companies do not pay out dividends to common stock at all.

## Authorized Shares
The number of authorized shares can be substantially greater than the number of shares outstanding since authorized shares represents the maximum possible number of shares a company can issue. The outstanding number of shares may be either equal to or less than the number of authorized shares. This is the number of shares specified in the company's charter.

## Shares Outstanding
Outstanding shares represent the number of a company’s shares that are traded on a primary or secondary market and, therefore, available to investors. Outstanding shares include all restricted shares held by the company’s officers and insiders (senior employees), as well as the equity portion owned by institutional investors such as mutual funds, pension funds, and hedge funds.

## Floating Shares (aka Public float)
The number of shares outstanding minus closely-held shares – a large number of shares that are held by one party, be it an individual or a small group of controlling shareholders, such as officers or directors of the company.

## Cancelled Shares
When a company cancels shares, thus reducing the total available number of shares. This action is non-reversible.

## Treasury Shares
The number of shares that are held by the company. The benefits of a corporation increasing its holdings of treasury stock include the ability to positively affect the per share price of the remaining stock on the market, to use the stock to provide incentives to employees in lieu of cash, to protect the company against hostile takeover attempts and to return capital to shareholders in a way that has a more positive tax result.

## Private Placement Memorandum
Is like a prospectus for private equity offerings. If you have set a high a par value say $5 per share and allocated 100,000 shares for your private equity offering, the minimum valuation is $500,000. If your company does not have $500,000 in assets, you may wish to specify in your private placement memorandum "use of proceeds," a budget to acquired assets to increase total company net asset value above $500,000?

## Over-the-counter (OTC)
From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_(finance)

Over-the-counter (OTC) or off-exchange trading is done directly between two parties, without the supervision of an exchange. It is contrasted with exchange trading, which occurs via exchanges. A stock exchange has the benefit of facilitating liquidity, providing transparency, and maintaining the current market price. In an OTC trade, the price is not necessarily publicly disclosed.

## Securities Underwriters
A different form of underwriter from all of these are securities underwriters, who work frequently with initial public offerings (IPOs). They will assess the investment's riskiness to help determine the appropriate price for an IPO, buy securities and then sell them. Often, the underwriter for securities is the investment bank and the specialists they employ. One of the bigger risks here is that should there not be as much fanfare for these securities, the investment bank may be stuck owning more of it than they anticipated.
