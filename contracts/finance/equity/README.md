# Asset Allocation
Recommended asset allocation,

    Total Authorized Shares   = 1,000,000,000,000 (1 trillion)  * $5 par value = $5,000,000,000,000

    Treasury Shares  (51%)        =   501,000,000,000 (501 billion) * $5 = $2.5 trillion
    Preferred Shares (10%)        =   100,000,000,000 (100 billion) * $5 = $500 billion
    
    Common Shares (20%)           =   200,000,000,000 (200 billion) * $5 = $1 trillion
    Employee Benefits (5%)        =        50,000,000 (50 million) * $5  = $250 million
        (includes Founder shares)
    Mergers & Acquisitions (14%)  =       140,000,000 (140 million) * $5 = $700 million

Recommend the state charter or Articles of Incorporation should be amended to list your asset allocation. The admendment to an Articles of Incorporation becomes public record and adds transparency to your organization. When dealing with security offerings and laws, the more public transparency the board can bring without disclosing trade secrets, the better!

# Equity Management Software
When conducting a private equity offering, you need to manage the investors and requires equity management software. A youtube link of possible solutions at https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22equity+management+software%22

## Preferred vs Common Shares

                    	        Common Shares       Preferred Shares
                                -------------       ----------------
    Company Ownership               Yes                 Yes
    Voting Rights                   Yes                 No
    Dividend                        Variable            Fixed
    Order of Claim to Earnings      Second              First
    Returns based on                Earnings            Earnings
 
Preferred shares are best suited for exempt offerings since a limited number of investors can participate while Common shares are best reseerved for public offerings including crowdfunding where any investor can participate.


# Exempt Offerings
See more at https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/exemptofferings

The perpose of creating exempt offerings on the blockchain even though they are restricted securities, is to offer liquidity to accredited investors after certain conditions have met, if any, for the accredited investors to liquidate with other investors, as well as to have a trading platform in-place when a public offering becomes effective and those existing securities become unrestricted.

A traditional private placement offering involves filing a FORM D on the SEC.GOV EDGAR filing system, creating a private placement memorandum and then searching for qualified and accredited investors. Prior to cryptocurrency and blockchain, liquidity in the private equity markets was limited until the company initiated an IPO. Under rule 144, creates liquidity in a private equity offering after twelve months from each sale of restricted securities. Using cryptocurrency for the private equity offering on the Ethereum network can create compliance liquidity before an IPO as well as generate a market value.

(THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS OPINIONS, SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION, etc. AND NOT LEGAL NOR INVESTMENT ADVICE!)

The introduction to equity trading tokens on the etheruem network make the search for accredited investors easier because liquidity is possible after the first twelve months of the offering under Rule 144. The market rate of the equity is established when the accredited investors have resold their holdings after twelve months have lapsed. Establishing a market rate in a private equity offering can prevent exorbitant valuations when a full IPO/DPO via a S-1 becomes effective.

Issuing preferred stock only during the private equity offering adds protection for the investors by placing them in a protected class similar to creditors, so in the event of court-ordered liquidation, the company assets can be sold to recover preferred equity investors funds.

A private equity offering should limit the maximum preferred shares to 10% of the total authorized shares specified in the company's charter, otherwise additional reporting requirements will be needed when new investors are vested. For example, a company with 1,000,000 authorized shares listed in it's charter, should limit private equity preferred outstanding shares to 100,000. The remaining 900,000 authorized shares can used for other offerings at a later date.

An example of an exempt offering on the Ropsten Test Network at https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x39db214c0373eda0eeee10bbf3fdc49a7faec46d

Anyone using a metamask can connect to the contract, but they cannot buy any Equity Tokens unless they have been whitelisted. Whitelisting investor wallets maintain the safe harbor exemption.

## Intrastate:Section 3(a)(11)
See https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/exemptofferings/intrastateofferings

Section 3(a)(11) of the Securities Act is generally known as the “intrastate offering exemption.” This exemption seeks to facilitate the financing of local business operations. To qualify for the intrastate offering exemption, a company must:
 
    - be organized in the state where it is offering the securities
    - carry out a significant amount of its business in that state and
    - make offers and sales only to residents of that state
    - resales have a holding period of six months from purchase
 
The intrastate offering exemption does not limit the size of the offering or the number of purchasers. A company must determine the residence of each offeree and purchaser. If any of the securities are offered or sold to even one out-of-state person, the exemption may be lost. Without the exemption, the company would be in violation of the Securities Act if the offering does not qualify for another exemption.

## Intrastate: Rule 147
See https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/exemptofferings/intrastateofferings

Rule 147 is considered a “safe harbor” under Section 3(a)(11), providing objective standards that a company can rely on to meet the requirements of that exemption. Rule 147, as amended, has the following requirements:

    - the company must be organized in the state where it offers and sells securities
    - the company must have its “principal place of business” in-state and satisfy at least one “doing business” requirement that demonstrates the in-state
     nature of the company’s business
    - offers and sales of securities can only be made to in-state residents or persons who the company reasonably believes are in-state residents and
    - the company obtains a written representation from each purchaser providing the residency of that purchaser
 
Securities purchased in an offering under Rule 147 limit resales to persons residing within the state of the offering for a period of six months from the date of the sale by the issuer to the purchaser. In addition, a company must comply with state securities laws and regulations in the states in which securities are offered or sold.

Example: a company must be incorporated and doing business in Florida and can only offer a private equity exempt offering to the residents of Florida ONLY!

### Intrastate: Rule 147A
See https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/exemptofferings/intrastateofferings

Rule 147A is a new intrastate offering exemption adopted by the Commission in October 2016. Rule 147A is substantially identical to Rule 147 except that Rule 147A:

   - allows offers to be accessible to out-of-state residents, so long sales are only made to in-state residents and
   - permits a company to be incorporated or organized out-of-state, so long as the company has its “principal place of business” in-state
     and satisfies at least one “doing business” requirement that demonstrates the in-state nature of the company’s business
 
Example: a company may be incorporated in Delaware and doing business in Florida, and hence may offer private equity sales in Florida as long as they meet the "doing business" criteria. If business meets the "doing business" requirement for both states, then a private equity offering may be offered to the residents of both the state of Delaware and Florida.

## Section 4(a)(2)
See https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/exemptofferings/rule506b

To qualify for this exemption, which is sometimes referred to as the “private placement” exemption, the purchasers of the securities must

   - either have enough knowledge and experience in finance and business matters to be “sophisticated investors” (able to evaluate the risks and merits of the investment),
     or be able to bear the investment’s economic risk
   - have access to the type of information normally provided in a prospectus for a registered securities offering and
   - agree not to resell or distribute the securities to the public
 
In general, public advertising of the offering, and general solicitation of investors, is incompatible with the private placement exemption.

The precise limits of the private placement exemption are not defined by rule. As the number of purchasers increases and their relationship to the company and its management becomes more remote, it is more difficult to show that the offering qualifies for this exemption. If your company offers securities to even one person who does not meet the necessary conditions, the entire offering may be in violation of the Securities Act.

## Rule 504
Rule 504 permits certain issuers to offer and sell up to $1 million of securities in any 12-month period.  These securities may be sold to any number and type of investor, and the issuer is not subject to specific disclosure requirements. Generally, securities issued under Rule 504 will be restricted securities (as further explained below), unless the offering meets certain additional requirements. As a prospective investor, you should confirm with the issuer whether the securities being offered under this rule will be restricted.

## Rule 505
Under Rule 505, issuers may offer and sell up to $5 million of their securities in any 12-month period.  There are limits on the types of investors who may purchase the securities.  The issuer may sell to an unlimited number of accredited investors, but to no more than 35 non-accredited investors.  If the issuer sells its securities to non-accredited investors, the issuer must disclose certain information about itself, including its financial statements.  If sales are made only to accredited investors, the issuer has discretion as to what to disclose to investors.  Any information provided to accredited investors must be provided to non-accredited investors.

## Rule 506(b)
See https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/exemptofferings/

Rule 506(b) of Regulation D is considered a “safe harbor” under Section 4(a)(2). It provides objective standards that a company can rely on to meet the requirements of the Section 4(a)(2) exemption. Companies conducting an offering under Rule 506(b) can raise an unlimited amount of money and can sell securities to an unlimited number of accredited investors. An offering under Rule 506(b), however, is subject to the following requirements:

   - no general solicitation or advertising to market the securities
   - securities may not be sold to more than 35 non-accredited investors (all non-accredited investors, either alone or with a purchaser representative,
     must meet the legal standard of having sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters to be capable of evaluating the merits and
     risks of the prospective investment)
 
 If non-accredited investors are participating in the offering, the company conducting the offering:
 
   - must give any non-accredited investors disclosure documents that generally contain the same type of information as provided in Regulation A offerings
     (the company is not required to provide specified disclosure documents to accredited investors, but, if it does provide information to accredited investors,
     it must also make this information available to the non-accredited investors as well)
   - must give any non-accredited investors financial statement information specified in Rule 506 and
   - should be available to answer questions from prospective purchasers who are non-accredited investors
 
Purchasers in a Rule 506(b) offering receive “restricted securities." A company is required to file a notice with the Commission on Form D within 15 days after the first sale of securities in the offering. Although the Securities Act provides a federal preemption from state registration and qualification under Rule 506(b), the states still have authority to require notice filings and collect state fees.

## Rule 506(c)
See https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/exemptofferings/rule506c

Rule 506(c) permits issuers to broadly solicit and generally advertise an offering, provided that:
 
   - all purchasers in the offering are accredited investors
   - the issuer takes reasonable steps to verify purchasers’ accredited investor status and
   - certain other conditions in Regulation D are satisfied
 
Purchasers in a Rule 506(c) offering receive “restricted securities.” A company is required to file a notice with the Commission on Form D within 15 days after the first sale of securities in the offering. Although the Securities Act provides a federal preemption from state registration and qualification under Rule 506(c), the states still have authority to require notice filings and collect state fees.

## Rule 701 - Employee benefit plans
See https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/exemptofferings/rule701

Rule 701 exempts certain sales of securities made to compensate employees, consultants and advisors. This exemption is not available to Exchange Act reporting companies. A company can sell at least $1 million of securities under this exemption, regardless of its size. A company can sell even more if it satisfies certain formulas based on its assets or on the number of its outstanding securities. If a company sells more than $10 million in securities in a 12-month period, it is required to provide certain financial and other disclosure to the persons that received securities in that period. Securities issued under Rule 701 are “restricted securities” and may not be freely traded unless the securities are registered or the holders can rely on an exemption

## Regulation A: Tier 1
See https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/regulation

Under Tier 1, an issuer can raise up to $20 million in any 12-month period, including no more than $6 million on behalf of selling security holders that are affiliates of the issuer.  In addition to qualification by SEC staff, companies offering securities pursuant to Tier 1 of Regulation A will also need to file and have their offering statements qualified by the state securities regulators in the states in which the issuer plans to sell its securities. Companies offering securities under Tier 1 do not have ongoing reporting requirements other than a final report on Form 1-Z on the status of the offering.

## Regulation A: Tier 2
See https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/regulation

Under Tier 2, an issuer can raise up to $50 million in any 12-month period, including no more than $15 million on behalf of selling securityholders that are affiliates of the issuer.  Unlike Tier 1 offerings, the offering statement does not have to be qualified by a state securities regulator, and the issuer is subject to ongoing reporting requirements in the form of an annual report on Form 1-K, a semiannual report on Form 1-SA and a current report on Form 1-U.

## Regulation Crowdfunding; Section 4(a)(6)
See https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/secg/rccomplianceguide-051316.htm

c. Transactions Conducted Through an Intermediary

Each Regulation Crowdfunding offering must be exclusively conducted through one online platform. The intermediary operating the platform must be a broker-dealer or a funding portal that is registered with the SEC and FINRA.

Issuers may rely on the efforts of the intermediary to determine that the aggregate amount of securities purchased by an investor does not cause the investor to exceed the investment limits, so long as the issuer does not have knowledge that the investor would exceed the investment limits as a result of purchasing securities in the issuer’s offering.

IMPORTANT NOTE: BECUASE OF THE REGULATIONS FOR CROWD FUNDING MUST BE CONDUCTED THROUGH AN INTERMEDIATARY THAT IS REGISTERED AS A BROKER-DEAKER OR FUNDING PORTAL WITH THE SEC AND FINRA, THIS CROWDFUNDING TOKEN IS USEFUL FOR ONLY A REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER OR FUNDING PORTAL THAT DESIRES TO OFFER A CRYPTOCURRENCY.

An example of a crowdfunding token at https://github.com/JincorTech/ico/blob/master/contracts/JincorToken.sol

## Regulation S
See https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-7505.htm

Regulation S offering permits US-based issuers to sell securities to off-shore investors while 506(c) is restricted to US-ONLY investors.

Regulation D 504(c) and Regulation S are typically conducted simultaneously.

While a Regulation S offering is a restricted security that can freely be traded in the offshore markets, there is no safe harbor for resale back into the USA, unless the Reg S equity token has an exchange proivision with a Reg 506 Equity Token to a whitelisted wallet. A neww DEX exchange contract needs to be created to handle transfers between a Regulation S off-shore wallet and a whitelisted Regulation 506 domestic wallet. The exchange would need to be a one-way transfer to the whitelisted domestic wallet.

# Why an Exempt Offering on the Blockchain?
Prior to exempt blockchain offering, the accredited investor would have to wait for the company to conduct an unrestricted IPO before they can sell their holdings. Using the blockchain for exempt offerings, liquidity is automatically available based on the exemption?

# A Defi DAPP is required
A Decentralized-finance (Defi) distributed application (DAPP) is required to maintain SEC compliance for exempt offerings including but not limited to KYC, AML, and Transfer Agent responsibilities.

The source code for the Defi DAPP will reside in the src directory

# Funding Categories

The former meaning, (see more at https://www.startups.com/library/expert-advice/series-funding-a-b-c-d-e)

    Series A - pre-seed funding private individuals and entities
    Series B - private equity
    Series C - higher funding goals that regulation A+ offers

the former series of funding was sequential, A before B before C?

the new meaning,

    Series A - under the rules for Regulation A
    Series B - under the rules for Regulation B (bank and institutional investors)
    Series C - under the rules for Regulation CF - Crowdfunding
    Series D - under the rules for Regulation D (this repository)
    Series 10 - under the rules of Regulation 10-12/G|B

the new definition permits any order of funding based on the SEC regulation?

# Project Structure
This project is being built for both ethereum and solana blockchains, where the source code resides in the respective directories

# Architecture
Solidity is an object-oriented language with inheritance and encapsulation (like C++ and Java). Proper OOP is to break up complex operations into smaller units, hence a method should ONLY perform a single task. Bugs get introduced when a method becomes a multitasker?

Solidity has contracts (like Classes in C++) and they can be abstract (which means they must be inherited), they have virtual and override functions, and they have library contracts which don't get inherited. If you are unfamaliar with OOP concepts and your parents were programmers, ask for the olde C++ and OOP methodologies as the same principles apply and can be adapted for Solidity smart contract programming.

The hierarchy of these contacts is the exempt offering contract is the top level and has unique properties (methods and data) unique to that offering. There are common entities used in all exempt offerings.

First, indetifying the main entities,

    ExemptEquityOffering506C

Second, identify the common entities all offerings include,

    Transfer Agent = required when applying for a CUSIP number, otherwise not required for an exempt offering
    Shareholder    = there are three distinct types: accredited, non-accredited and affiliate
    Shares         = the equity of the offering
    Transaction    = a record of each transaction (while this is kept on the blockchain, having a separate entity assists with recording keeping compliance)
    Account        = account
