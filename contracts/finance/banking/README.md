# Blockchain in Banking
The banking industry is highly regulated in the United States, and may be too much for most dreamers. The quickest entrancy to the banking is to become a neobank which operates offer an existing registered bank. Prior to the acquisition of BBVA by PNC Bank, BBVA had the best framework for creating new neobanks.

Aurora.dev is the first decentralized blockchain banking platform. Aurora is NOT a bank but a platform that can be used by the banking industry.

# Types of Banks
From https://smartasset.com/checking-account/types-of-banks

    Central Bank
        Central banks manage the money supply in a single country or a series of nations. They supervise commercial banks, set interest rates and control the flow of currency.
        Central banks also implement a government’s monetary policy goals, whether that involves combating deflation or keeping prices from fluctuating. 
    Retail Bank
        Retail banks offer members of the general public financial products and services such as bank accounts, loans, credit cards and insurance. In some cases, they can set up checking accounts and make loans for small-scale businesses as well.
    Commercial Bank
        Although there are some types of commercial banks that help everyday consumers, commercial banks tend to concentrate on supporting businesses. Both large corporations and small businesses can turn to commercial banks if they need to open a checking or savings account, borrow money, get access to credit or transfer funds to companies in foreign markets.
    Shadow Bank
        The shadow banking system consists of financial groups that aren’t bound by the same strict rules and regulations that other banks have to comply with. Much like the standard regulated banks, shadow banks deal with credit and different kinds of assets. But they get their funding by borrowing it, connecting with investors or making their own funds instead of using money issued by the central bank.

        Money market funds and hedge funds are two kinds of shadow banks. More recently, they’ve been a source of controversy for quite a few people. Many folks blame the less-regulated shadow banking industry for playing a role in the mortgage crisis leading up to the Great Recession.
    Investment Bank
        Investment banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have many responsibilities. On one hand, they manage the trading of stocks, bonds and other securities between companies and investors. On the other hand, they might focus their energy on advising individuals and corporations who need financial guidance, reorganizing companies through mergers and acquisitions, managing investment portfolios or raising money for certain businesses and the federal government.
    Cooperative Bank
        Cooperatives can be either retail banks or commercial banks. What distinguishes them from other entities in the financial system is the fact that they’re typically local or community-based associations whose members help determine how the business is operated. They’re run democratically and they offer loans and banks accounts, among other things. They’re popular in countries throughout the world and in the U.S. they usually take the form of credit unions.
    Credit Unions
        Like banks, credit unions issue loans, provide savings and checking accounts and meet other financial needs for consumers and businesses. The difference is that banks are for-profit companies while credit unions are not. 
    Savings and Loan Associations
        Technically speaking, savings and loan associations aren’t banks. Often referred to as thrifts or S&Ls, they’re financial institutions that primarily use deposited savings to create mortgages, refinance loans and other home loans that their customers can use to build or renovate their homes. Some thrifts have additional functions and some are publicly traded companies.

# Peer-to-Peer Lending
This type of lending falls under the shadow banking paradigm and most suitable for blockchain. A legitimate peer-to-peer lending operation is licensed at least by the state.

(e) Requirements -

    (1) In general.

        (i) The OCC charters a national bank under the authority of the National Bank Act of 1864, as amended, 12 U.S.C. 1 et seq. The bank may be a special purpose bank that limits its activities to fiduciary activities or to any other activities within the business of banking. A special purpose bank that conducts activities other than fiduciary activities must conduct at least one of the following three core banking functions: Receiving deposits; paying checks; or lending money. The name of a proposed national bank must include the word “national.”

        (ii) The OCC charters a Federal savings association under the authority of section 5 of the Home Owners' Loan Act, 12 U.S.C. 1464, which in an application to establish a Federal savings association requires the OCC to consider:

            (A) Whether the filers are persons of good character and responsibility;

            (B) Whether a necessity exists for the association in the community to be served;

            (C) Whether there is a reasonable probability of the association's usefulness and success; and

            (D) Whether the association can be established without undue injury to properly conducted existing local savings associations and home financing institutions.

        (iii) In determining whether to approve an application to establish a national bank or Federal savings association, the OCC verifies that the proposed national bank or Federal savings association has complied with the following requirements. A national bank or a Federal savings association must:

            (A) File either articles of association (for a national bank), or a charter and by-laws (for a Federal savings association) with the OCC;

            (B) In the case of an application to establish a national bank, file an organization certificate containing specified information with the OCC;

            (C) Ensure that all capital stock is paid in, or in the case of a Federal mutual savings association, ensure that at least a minimum amount of capital is paid in; and

            (D) Have at least five elected directors.

    (2) Community Reinvestment Act. Twelve CFR part 25 requires the OCC to take into account a proposed insured national bank's or Federal savings association's description of how it will meet its CRA objectives.

    (3) Federal Deposit Insurance. Preliminary approval for an application to establish a Federal savings association will be conditioned on the savings association applying for and receiving approval for deposit insurance from the FDIC. Final approval for an application to establish a Federal savings association will not be issued until receipt by the OCC of written confirmation by the FDIC that the accounts of the Federal savings association will be insured by the FDIC.

(f) Policy -

    (1) In general. In determining whether to approve an application to establish a national bank or Federal savings association, the OCC is guided by the following principles:

        (i) Maintaining a safe and sound banking system;

        (ii) Encouraging a national bank or Federal savings association to provide fair access to financial services by helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community;

        (iii) Ensuring compliance with laws and regulations; and

        (iv) Promoting fair treatment of customers including efficiency and better service.

    (2) Policy considerations.

        (i) In evaluating an application to establish a national bank or Federal savings association, the OCC considers whether the proposed institution:

            (A) Has organizers who are familiar with national banking laws and regulations or Federal savings association laws and regulations, respectively;

            (B) Has competent management, including a board of directors, with ability and experience relevant to the types of services to be provided;

            (C) Has capital that is sufficient to support the projected volume and type of business;

            (D) Can reasonably be expected to achieve and maintain profitability;

            (E) Will be operated in a safe and sound manner; and

            (F) Does not have a title that misrepresents the nature of the institution or the services it offers.

        (ii) In evaluating an application to establish a Federal savings association, the OCC considers whether the proposed Federal savings association will be operated as a qualified thrift lender under section 10(m) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, 12 U.S.C. 1467a(m).

        (iii) The OCC may also consider additional factors listed in section 6 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1816, including the risk to the Federal deposit insurance fund, and whether the proposed institution's corporate powers are consistent with the purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the National Bank Act, and the Home Owners' Loan Act, as applicable.

    (3) OCC evaluation. The OCC evaluates a proposed institution's organizing group and its business plan or operating plan together. The OCC's judgment concerning one may affect the evaluation of the other. An organizing group and its business plan or operating plan must be stronger in markets where economic conditions are marginal or competition is intense.

(g) Organizing group -

    (1) In general. Strong organizing groups generally include diverse business and financial interests and community involvement. An organizing group must have the experience, competence, willingness, and ability to be active in directing the proposed institution's affairs in a safe and sound manner. The institution's initial board of directors generally is comprised of many, if not all, of the organizers. The business plan or operating plan and other information supplied in the application must demonstrate an organizing group's collective ability to establish and operate a successful national bank or Federal savings association in the economic and competitive conditions of the market to be served. Each organizer should be knowledgeable about the business plan or operating plan. A poor business plan or operating plan reflects adversely on the organizing group's ability, and the OCC generally denies applications with poor business plans or operating plans.

    (2) Management selection. The initial board of directors must select competent senior executive officers before the OCC grants final approval. Early selection of executive officers, especially the chief executive officer, contributes favorably to the preparation and review of a business plan or operating plan that is accurate, complete, and appropriate for the type of national bank or Federal savings association proposed and its market, and reflects favorably upon an application. As a condition of the charter approval, the OCC retains the right to object to and preclude the hiring of any officer, or the appointment or election of any director, for a two-year period from the date the institution commences business, or longer as appropriate.

    (3) Financial resources.

        (i) Each organizer must have a history of responsibility, personal honesty, and integrity. Personal wealth is not a prerequisite to become an organizer or director of a national bank or Federal savings association. However, directors' stock purchases, or, in the case of a Federal mutual savings association, capital contributions, individually and in the aggregate, should reflect a financial commitment to the success of the institution that is reasonable in relation to their individual and collective financial strength. A director should not have to depend on institution dividends, fees, or other compensation to satisfy financial obligations.

        (ii) Because directors are often the primary source of additional capital for an institution not affiliated with a holding company, it is desirable that the proposed directors of the national bank or Federal savings association, as a group, be able to supply or have a realistic plan to enable the institution to obtain capital when needed.

        (iii) Any financial or other business arrangement, direct or indirect, between the organizing group or other insiders and the proposed national bank or Federal savings association must be on nonpreferential terms.

    (4) Organizational expenses.

        (i) Organizers are expected to contribute time and expertise to the organization of the national bank or Federal savings association. Organizers should not bill excessive charges to the institution for professional and consulting services or unduly rely upon these fees as a source of income.

        (ii) A proposed national bank or Federal savings association may not pay any fee that is contingent upon an OCC decision. Such action generally is grounds for denial of the application or nullification or rescission of a preliminary approval. Organizational expenses for denied applications are the sole responsibility of the organizing group.

    (5) Sponsor's experience and support. A sponsor must be financially able to support the new institution's operations and to provide or locate capital when needed. The OCC primarily considers the financial and managerial resources of the sponsor and the sponsor's record of performance, rather than the financial and managerial resources of the organizing group, if an organizing group is sponsored by:

        (i) An existing holding company;

        (ii) Individuals currently affiliated with other depository institutions; or

        (iii) Individuals who, in the OCC's view, are otherwise collectively experienced in banking and have demonstrated the ability to work together effectively.

(h) Business plan or Operating plan -

    (1) In general.

        (i) Organizers of a proposed national bank or Federal savings association must submit a business plan or operating plan that adequately addresses the statutory and policy considerations set forth in paragraphs (e) and (f)(2) of this section. In the case of a proposed Federal savings association the plan must also specifically address meeting qualified thrift lender requirements. The plan must reflect sound banking principles and demonstrate realistic assessments of risk in light of economic and competitive conditions in the market to be served.

        (ii) The OCC may offset deficiencies in one factor by strengths in one or more other factors. However, deficiencies in some factors, such as unrealistic earnings prospects, may have a negative influence on the evaluation of other factors, such as capital adequacy, or may be serious enough by themselves to result in denial. The OCC considers inadequacies in a business plan or operating plan to reflect negatively on the organizing group's ability to operate a successful institution.

    (2) Earnings prospects. The organizing group must submit pro forma balance sheets and income statements as part of the business plan or operating plan. The OCC reviews all projections for reasonableness of assumptions and consistency with the business plan or operating plan.

    (3) Management.

        (i) The organizing group must include in the business plan or operating plan information sufficient to permit the OCC to evaluate the overall management ability of the organizing group. If the organizing group has limited banking experience or community involvement, the senior executive officers must be able to compensate for such deficiencies.

        (ii) The organizing group may not hire an officer or elect or appoint a director if the OCC objects to that person at any time prior to the date the institution commences business.

    (4) Capital. A proposed bank or Federal savings association must have sufficient initial capital, net of any organizational expenses that will be charged to the institution's capital after it begins operations, to support the institution's projected volume and type of business.

    (5) Community service.

        (i) The business plan or operating plan must indicate the organizing group's knowledge of and plans for serving the community. The organizing group must evaluate the banking needs of the community, including its consumer, business, nonprofit, and government sectors. The business plan or operating plan must demonstrate how the proposed national bank or Federal savings association responds to those needs consistent with the safe and sound operation of the institution. The provisions of this paragraph may not apply to an application to organize an institution for a special purpose.

        (ii) As part of its business plan or operating plan, the organizing group must submit a statement that demonstrates its plans to achieve CRA objectives.

        (iii) Because community support is important to the long-term success of a national bank or Federal savings association, the organizing group must include plans for attracting and maintaining community support.

    (6) Safety and soundness. The business plan or operating plan must demonstrate that the organizing group (and the sponsoring company, if any), is aware of, and understands, applicable depository institution laws and regulations, and safe and sound banking operations and practices. The OCC will deny an application that does not meet these safety and soundness requirements.

    (7) Fiduciary powers. The business plan or operating plan must indicate if the proposed institution intends to exercise fiduciary powers. The information required by § 5.26 must be filed with the charter application. A separate application is not required.

        (i) Procedures -

            (1) Prefiling meeting. The OCC normally requires a prefiling meeting with the organizers of a proposed national bank or Federal savings association before the organizers file an application. Organizers should be familiar with the OCC's chartering policy and procedural requirements in the Comptroller's Licensing Manual before the prefiling meeting. The prefiling meeting normally is held in the district office where the application will be filed but may be held at another location at the request of the filer.

            (2) Business plan or operating plan. An organizing group must file a business plan or operating plan that addresses the subjects discussed in paragraph (h) of this section.

            (3) Biographical and financial reports. (i) Each proposed organizer, director, executive officer, or principal shareholder must submit to the appropriate OCC licensing office:

                (A) The information prescribed in the Interagency Biographical and Financial Report, available at www.occ.gov; and

                (B) Legible fingerprints.

                    (ii) The OCC may require additional information about any proposed organizer, director, executive officer, or principal shareholder, if appropriate. The OCC may waive any of the information requirements of this paragraph if the OCC determines that it is in the public interest.

            (4) Contact person. The organizing group must designate a contact person to represent the organizing group in all contacts with the OCC. The contact person must be an organizer and proposed director of the new national bank or Federal savings association, except a representative of the sponsor or sponsors may serve as contact person if an application is sponsored by an existing holding company, individuals currently affiliated with other depository institutions, or individuals who, in the OCC's view, are otherwise collectively experienced in banking and have demonstrated the ability to work together effectively.

            (5) Decision notification. The OCC notifies the contact person and other relevant parties in writing of its decision on an application.

            (6) Activities.

                (i) Before the OCC grants final approval, a proposed national bank or Federal savings association must be established as a legal entity. A national bank becomes a legal entity after it has filed its organization certificate and articles of association with the OCC as required by law. A Federal savings association becomes a legal entity after it has filed its proposed charter and bylaws with the OCC. A proposed national bank may offer and sell securities prior to OCC preliminary approval of the proposed national bank's charter application, provided that the proposed national bank has filed articles of association, an organization certificate, and a completed charter application and the bank complies with paragraph (i)(6)(iii) of this section. A proposed Federal stock savings association may offer and sell securities prior to OCC preliminary approval of the proposed Federal stock savings association's charter application, provided that the proposed Federal stock savings association has filed a proposed charter, bylaws, and a completed charter application and the Federal stock savings association complies with paragraph (i)(6)(iii) of this section.

                (ii)

                    (A) After the OCC grants preliminary approval, the organizing group must elect a board of directors, take steps necessary to organize the proposed national bank or Federal savings association and prepare it for commencing business.

                    (B) A proposed national bank may not conduct the business of banking until the OCC grants final approval and issues a charter. A proposed Federal savings association may not commence business until the OCC grants final approval and issues a charter, which must be in the form provided in this part.

                (iii) For all capital obtained through a public offering a proposed national bank or Federal savings association must use an offering circular that complies with the OCC's securities offering regulations, 12 CFR part 16, as applicable. All securities of a particular class in the initial offering must be sold at the same price.

                (iv) A national bank or Federal savings association in organization must raise its capital before it commences business. Preliminary approval expires if the proposed national bank or Federal savings association does not raise the required capital within 12 months from the date the OCC grants preliminary approval. Preliminary approval expires if the proposed national bank or Federal savings association does not commence business within 18 months from the date of preliminary approval, unless the OCC grants an extension. If preliminary approval expires, all cash collected on subscriptions must be returned.

(j) Expedited review. An application to establish a full-service national bank or Federal savings association that is sponsored by a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company whose lead depository institution is an eligible bank or eligible savings association is deemed preliminarily approved by the OCC as of the 15th day after the close of the public comment period or the 45th day after the filing is received by the OCC, whichever is later, unless the OCC:

    (1) Notifies the filer prior to that date that the filing has been removed from expedited review, or the expedited review process is extended, under § 5.13(a)(2); or

    (2) Notifies the filer prior to that date that the OCC has determined that the proposed bank will offer banking services that are materially different than those offered by the lead depository institution.

(k) National bankers' banks -

    (1) Activities and customers. In addition to the other requirements of this section, when an organizing group seeks to organize a national bankers' bank, the organizing group must list in the application the anticipated activities and customers or clients of the proposed national bankers' bank.

    (2) Waiver of requirements. At the organizing group's request, the OCC may waive requirements that are applicable to national banks in general if those requirements are inappropriate for a national bankers' bank and would impede its ability to provide desired services to its market. A filer must submit a request for a waiver with the application and must support the request with adequate justification and legal analysis. A national bankers' bank that is already in operation may also request a waiver. The OCC cannot waive statutory provisions that specifically apply to national bankers' banks pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 27(b)(1).

    (3) Investments. A national bank or Federal savings association may invest up to 10 percent of its capital and surplus in a bankers' bank and may own five percent or less of any class of a bankers' bank's voting securities.

(l) Special purpose institutions -

    (1) In general. A filer for a national bank or Federal savings association charter that will limit its activities to fiduciary activities, credit card operations, or another special purpose must adhere to established charter procedures with modifications appropriate for the circumstances as determined by the OCC. A filer for a national bank or Federal savings association charter that will have a community development focus must also adhere to established charter procedures with modifications appropriate for the circumstances as determined by the OCC. A national bank that seeks to invest in a bank or savings association with a community development focus must comply with applicable requirements of 12 CFR part 24. A Federal savings association that seeks to invest in a bank or savings association with a community development focus must comply with § 160.36 or any other applicable requirements.

    (2) Changes in charter purpose. An existing national bank or Federal savings association whose activities are limited to a special purpose that desires to change to another special purpose, to add another special purpose, or to no longer be limited to a special purpose charter must submit an application and obtain prior OCC approval under § 5.53. An existing national bank or Federal savings association whose activities are not limited that desires to limit its activities and become a special purpose institution must submit an application and obtain prior OCC approval under § 5.53.

# Use Case
From https://www.leewayhertz.com/blockchain-in-banking/

## Clearance and Settlement
An average bank transfer usually takes few days to settle. So, moving money across the globe is a logistical challenge for many banks. The bank transfer system needs to go through custodial services and reconciliation process, which include:

    Fund networks
    Asset Managers
    Traders

For example: If you want to transfer the money from a German bank to the United States, the transfer process will go through Swift. A swift protocol is centralized and it processes only the payment orders. The actual money is processed through intermediaries involving additional cost and time.

A decentralized ledger technology like blockchain can help banks to monitor and settle transactions. Therefore, banks will not have to rely on custodial services and regulatory intermediaries. The following steps will help you to know how blockchain works for clearance and settlements in banking.

Step 1: When a user requests a payment, the payment transaction is represented in the form of a block.

Step2: This block is sent to the network of computers, known as nodes. So, the block representing the payment is sent to every node in the network.

Step 3: Nodes validate the payment and user’s status using algorithms. These nodes receive a reward for proof of work. The verified payment may include cryptocurrency, contracts, or any other information record.

Step 4: Once the payment is verified, it is combined with other payments to generate a new data block for the ledger.

Step 5: This new block containing payment information gets added to the existing blockchain and the payment gets completed.

Cross-border payments are fast, cost-effective as compared to conventional banking systems. With blockchain for cross-border payments, third parties’ verification gets eliminated, resulting in speeding up the processing time. For example, the remittance cost is just around 2 to 3 percent, while third parties estimate around 5 to 6 percent of the total amount). Juniper Research’s report states that deploying blockchain in banks will save on cross-border payment transactions up to 27billion dollars by 2030.

## Lending and borrowing
Lending and borrowing are the primary services offered by banks. The stakeholders involved are:

    Lender -the banks or financial institutions that give money.
    Borrower – the one who takes money from banks or financial institutions.
    Guarantor – the one who is the promising entity to repay the loan.

Let’s have a look at the workflow of lending and borrowing methods using blockchain.

Step 1: Lender generates a profile

A lender generates his profile containing:

    Personal details like name, address and ID
    Details of bank account
    Type of investment a lender would like to make. For example, a lender might wish to lend money to the borrowers requesting a loan for business purposes.
    Rate of interest associated with different types of borrowers involved in the network.
    The profile details are provided at the marketplace. Based on these details, the lenders and borrowers can find each other at the market.

Step 2: The lender looks forward to a loan request from the borrower

After submitting profile details at the marketplace, the lender waits for a loan request from the borrower. Once the request is received, the lender schedules an interview with the borrower for further discussion.

Step 3: Borrower generates a profile

A borrower creates a profile comprising personal details(name, address, ID) and collateral information. The collaterals could be specified in terms of legal documents,crypto-coins, etc.

Step 4: Borrower requests for the loan

Once the account is generated, a borrower can send loan requests to multiple lenders—smart Contracts help the borrower to reach the lender, who meets the requirements of his investments.

Step 5: The lender starts the discussion with the borrower

When the loan request is received, a lender begins the discussion with the borrower and try to get through –

    The reason to apply for the loan.
    Monthly earnings.
    Repayment rate.
    The number of times the borrower applied for the loan.

These details help the lender whether to approve or dismiss the borrower’s loan application.

Step 6: Smart Contract decides the rate of interest

Once the request is accepted, the smart contracts check the CIBIL score to decide the borrower’s rate. Based on repayment rates, borrowers fall into high risk, low risk and medium risk categories.

When using the P2P lending blockchain platform, the rate of interest remains constant.

Step 7: Smart Contracts facilitate auto-payments

Smart contracts embedded with a crypto-wallet can assist borrowers in making their payments. If the borrower fails to pay timely installments, late fees are added to the actual amount and upgraded on the ledger.

Blockchain in lending can be beneficial to:

    make fast approvals
    minimize delays
    reduce the need for intermediaries
    enhance transparency in the process.

## Accounting and Bookkeeping
Accounting is an area in banking, which is relatively slow in terms of digitization. The sole reason behind it is the necessity to match the regulatory requirements associated with data integrity and validation. Therefore, accounting needs transformation with blockchain.

The blockchain plays a crucial role in simplifying compliance and streamline the conventional double-entry bookkeeping methods. Despite keeping separate records of transaction receipts, the transaction can be directly added to the joint register using blockchain. Thus, all the entries of this register can be distributed on the blockchain. It will ensure the transparency and security of banking data. A blockchain can be just like a digital notary for verifying the transaction details. Smart contracts would enable the payments for generated invoices. Blockchain in accounting and bookkeeping improves efficiency, reporting, and data access.

## Trade Finance
Trade finance is concerned with all the financial activities to international trade and commerce. These activities still rely on paperwork such as letters of credit and invoices. Though management systems conduct these processes online, they consume a lot of time.

Therefore, trading based on blockchain solutions can streamline the process with less paperwork, low time consumption and minimum regulations.

For example: In traditional finance systems, all the users have to maintain their databases. They maintained databases for transaction-related documents and restored them continuously. If there is a single error on the page, this will duplicate this page’s copies in other databases.

With such challenging scenarios, blockchain-enabled solutions do not require multiple copies of the same page. It is so because the information gets integrated into a single digital document and then updated in real-time. This updated information is further access to all the users in the network.

Here’s how the blockchain is going to transform trade finance.

Step 1: When the buyer purchases goods from the seller, the sale agreement is shared with the import bank with smart contracts on the blockchain.

Step 2: The import bank reviews the purchase agreement and credit terms and then submits the obligation to pay to the export bank.

Step 3: The export bank reviews the received payment obligation and verifies it. Once approved, the smart contracts trigger the blockchain to include the terms and conditions and lock-in obligations.

Step 4: Once the obligations are received, the seller digitally signs the blockchain-equivalent letter of credit in a smart contract to proceed with the shipping.

Step 5: The goods are further monitored by third parties and custom agents in exporting country. All the goods are approved by signing digitally on blockchain smart contracts.

Step 6: The goods are transported from one country to another.

Step 7: On receiving the goods, the buyer digitally acknowledges the receipt and triggers the smart contracts for payment.

Step 8: The payment is processed from buyer to seller through smart contracts in blockchain.

## Making Credit Reports
Blockchain in banking can also help clients to get loans quickly based on their credit history. Lenders take a lot of time in reviewing the credit history. The credit reports provided by third parties are not available for small business owners. Therefore, blockchain tools can serve the purpose of making credit reports for borrowers. These reports ensure accuracy, transparency and secure distribution. The following steps will show how it works with blockchain.

Step 1: The data owners stores their transaction history in the blockchain. This information is protected with a private key.

Step 2: The encrypted transaction details are stored outside the blockchain.

Step 3: The encrypted transaction is stored with hash codes in the blockchain along with timestamps and metadata.

Step 4: The buyer submits the criteria for information on credit history.

Step 5: Based on criteria, smart contracts identify and verify the required information.

Step 6: : Upon verifying the potential data, the blockchain filters the unnecessary information and shows the required information of the borrower’s credit history.

Therefore, blockchain-based credit reports reduce the costs, time and complexities related to data verification.
