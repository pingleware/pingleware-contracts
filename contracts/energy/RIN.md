# Properties of a RIN

    D Code
    Vintage (Year produced)
    
# Future Opportunity
Create a consumer retail secondary market for RIN trading, just as a retail market was created for FOREX. There exists a retail market for resellers,
Just as with FOREX where the retail trader doesn't or possess the currency, the consumer RIN trader trades on the speculation of the price fluctations of the available RINS, withou ever possessing or owning any RINS. This consumer RINS trading can prevent the whales from price controlling and make the RINS marker more efficient.

The minimum rerquirements,

    - registered the trading platform as an ATS with the SEC
    - extract RIN pricing from EPA.GOV
