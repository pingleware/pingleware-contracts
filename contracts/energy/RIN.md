# Renewal Indentification Number (RIN)
From: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_Identification_Number

A Renewable Identification Number (or RIN) is a serial number assigned to a batch of biofuel for the purpose of tracking its production, use, and trading as required by the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) implemented according to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.

# Trading
Trading occurs using Renewal Energy Credits (REC) for which a RIN is assigned.See more at https://www.kirkcoburn.com/2021/02/04/recs-101-intro-renewable-energy-credits-2021

    - Buy — A RIN is bought or traded (the RIN can be attached to a batch of fuel or separated).
    - Sell — A RIN is sold or traded.
    - Retire — A RIN is used to demonstrate compliance or retired for other reasons.

When you buy or sell an RIN, both the buyer and seller must log into the EMTS system and report the certificate number. If all the numbers match, then the EPA will recognize the trade and log it.
