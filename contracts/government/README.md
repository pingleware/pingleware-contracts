# Blockchain in Government

Since the majority of governmental actions is public record, blockchain is suitable for governments.

A central bank digital currency (CBDC) does NOT centralized the blockchain but can bring stability to other cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the CBDC instead of another stable coin-like currency.

A government can create their own cryptocurrency on their own blockchain. Peer networks can inclluded authentication to only permit authorized peers. The finance department of the government (eg US Treasury) can be the sole miner and mining rewards serve as additional revenue. Also will help to stabilize the cryptocurrency issued by the government because of fewer miners and less gas costs. The peers are the states, counties and municipalities, with the miners onyl being within the government.

# NFT Marketplace is good for Governments

When a Government entity requires funds for a capital improvement project, they can launched a NFT on an existing NFT Marketplace, to generate the revenue required for the project without the need for raising taxes. A government entity is usually exempt from securities registration and trading laws, and the NFT token can be traded and exchanged on the NFT Marketplace between the marketplace participants. Currently the municipalities have access to create municipal bonds which must be paid back over time, a government NFT does not need to be paid back and can still generate income for the token holders/investor through secondary trading. The issuing municipality can also receive a percentage from resales.
