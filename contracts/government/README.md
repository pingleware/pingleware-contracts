# Blockchain in Government
Since the majority of governmental actions is public record, blockchain is suitable for governments.

A central bank digital currency (CBDC) does NOT centralized the blockchain but can bring stability to other cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the CBDC instead of another stable coin-like currency.

# NFT Marketplace is good for Governments
When a Government entity requires funds for a capital improvement project, they can launched a NFT on an existing NFT Marketplace, to generate the revenue required for the project without the need for raising taxes. A government entity is usually exempt from securities registration and trading laws, and the NFT token can be traded and exchanged on the NFT Marketplace between the marketplace participants. Currently the municipalities have access to create municipal bonds which must be paid back over time, a government NFT does not need to be paid back and can still generate income for the token holders/investor through secondary trading. The issuing municipality can also receive a percentage from resales.
