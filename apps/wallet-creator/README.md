# Wallet Creator

A standalone application that will create an ethereum wallet address with public and private keys and create a sign hash from a string message that can be used as a password when authenticating. The password should be stored in an off chain database with reference to the wallet address. DO NOT STORE THE PRIVATE KEYS IN THE OFF CHAIN DATABASE.

The public and private keys along with the wallet are sent to the user via a secured method. The user will import their new wallet into metamask using the private key.

The above wallet is real and generated by this application, will work on the ethereum-based blockchain but do not use it for live transactions.

The wallet imported into metamask as a COMMUNITY WALLET,

The COMMUNITY WALLET has a single Goerli Test Token for the Ethereum Smart Contract Creator at [https://testnets.opensea.io/assets/goerli/0xf4910c763ed4e47a585e2d34baa9a4b611ae448c/36333753202514414869774196218446368102124864803313914227828195908039628392096](https://testnets.opensea.io/assets/goerli/0xf4910c763ed4e47a585e2d34baa9a4b611ae448c/36333753202514414869774196218446368102124864803313914227828195908039628392096). You can download the application from [https://snapcraft.io/ethereum-contract-creator](https://snapcraft.io/ethereum-contract-creator), which requires a Goerli Test Token to gain access to the beta version available on snapcraft.io. You can always use your own wallet on the Goerli test network, request free test ether and buyu your own test token from the llink above.

You must import the community wallet into your metamask account using the above private key and set that wallet as the active wallet. Then download and launch the application. The first launch will setup your environment variables in a JSON file under your user directory, then subsequent launches require connecting to metamask with the Community Wallet (or your own wallet with a vallid license), that signs a message and starts the local blockchain.

## TODO

Store the keys on a hardware USB wallet that can interact with metamask.
